284950,Pixel Puzzles: Japan,"Its ok for what it is aldow i would not recommend it for a couple of reasons. The first puzzles work just fine the puzzles in the end are frustrating because you keep clicking on that 1 piece you want to pick up only to keep getting the one below it, and also the lack of a save feature i dont get its not like i cant walk away from a puzzle in real life to come back to it later on, well in this game you have to complete it or start over  a button to reset the puzzle rly? why would anyone wanna do that its not like its possible to make mistakes in a puzzle you eather got it or you dont  the puzzles themselves are nice and relaxing, the japanese music i like its relaxing so if you dont mind the biggest minus point of having no save feature you should stil have some good fun with it  i give it 5/10, 8/10 if they add a save feature and 9/10 if they make picking up the piece i want to pick up work",-1,0

2600,Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines,Very good game and very good adaption of the system and captures the feel of the world of darkenss very well.

311690,Enter the Gungeon,"if you dont know games like binding of isaac or nuclear throne you can skip this part  the game has a similar concept, you go in a randomly generated dungeon, get items that buff you, and get guns that might or might not be better than the one you already have, but it has its own charm, and i can see that the game's more bullet hell than binding of isaac, so if you liked that genre, hey, thats a bonus,   now...continuing on.  the game is a roguelite, which means a permadeath mechanic, when you die, you die for good (err well, in this particular game you just travel back in time and start over from the begining) , and your character starts from zero again, all the powerfull items you get for your character for that run is gone, depending to some this might be good or bad, to me permadeath means shorter sessions, its perfect for those who just want to waste a couple of hours time for fun and not worry about strategy in the long run (like say, an RPG game). while having permadeath means you start from the beginning of a dungeon again, it doesnt mean theres no progression to be made (it is a rogueLITE after all), at first only a few items or guns are unlocked for you, unlocked here meaning 'you can now find it on runs now', after you play for a bit you start unlocking new items and guns that you have the chance to find in the dungeon, adding interesting milestones for you other than just getting good and reaching the final boss. like binding of isaac, the game is more or less based on RNG, which means you can just find terrible items all day in dungeons on one run and immediately get an S rank gun on your first dungeon on the other run, to me the RNG isnt an issue here, i never really got frustrated by it and hey, thats part of the game.  TL;DR Good bullet hell game with lots of replayability, it wont bore you for quite some time, and you can just play whenever",1,0
209000,Batman™: Arkham Origins,"Batman:Arkham Origins is pretty good prequel of Akham Series. Gameplay based on previos Arkham games and he actually don't need any changes though, it not so well-balanced like in AA or AC, but still it best Batman videogame. Main advantage of Arkham Origins it's his plot and characters. Story is really great and seriosly hooked you. And perfect actor's perfomance absolutly cosolidate it. You still don't know who Troy Baker is? Well you not my friend anymore:joker:. 8.5/10. I reccomended this game to everyone.",1,0

378610,Valley,"I hardly ever write reviews but this gem deserves it. The game just screams high quality. It looks great. Runs great. Controls are fluid and tight. The story is interesting and combined with the thoughtful music this is just an all-around great game at a great price. Combat is fun and not too difficult but combat isn't the main focus.  I clocked 8 hours and 20 minutes to complete it but I didn't find all the secret doors and the levels are designed such that you could go back and explore more if you wanted to. Personally, as a 45 year old parent with limited game-time these days, I find a well-made title that does what it sets out to do and doesn't overstay its welcome to be very refreshing.  Take a chance and buy this game. Unless you need constant explosions and/or a fifty hour campaign to have a “good game.”",1,0

3590,Plants vs. Zombies: Game of the Year,"**14 Hours as of this review**   Years ago, I used to play a Nintendo DS Lite. Plants vs. Zombies was the best game I have ever played. Years passed, and I moved on to Nintendo 3DS, Xbox 360, and now PC (plan to stay here, lol.) Here I am today, and I picked up Plants vs. Zombies Game of the Year Edition for $2.49 in a Steam sale. Many memories were retained and experienced again. Disregarding those memories, this game proved itself to be a very great game, not the best I have played anymore, due to my wide array of game knowledge, but it does hold a title of awesomeness. Its is very funny, and very fun as well.",1,0

200710,Torchlight II,"This game pretty awesomes. I've been playing it a ton in offline mode and I think it has only ever crashed like one time. That's pretty great for modern games! All the classes can be pretty powerfuls. I've done a good part of 1st playthrough for most builds I could think up and they're all pretty great by the time they hit their 30s as long as you stick with synergistic skills. I love all the easter eggs, like Notch's Mine for examples. The secret end-game area of Tarroch's Tomb is pretty cools in refining your character, but gets kinda farmy after you do it a couple times, but by then you're probably on New Game+++ at least, so you're accustomed to repeating things.  Overall a pretty great game, especially if you're the sort of frood that likes making multiple toons.",1,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"It's like playing Counter Strike with Medieval settings.  This game is a multiplayer only, and I'm very happy with that. And by multiplayer that means it's much better to play this with real people instead of bots. I repeat: THE BOTS HERE ARE NOT FUN TO PLAY WITH (coz they can't feel emotions)   ***WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT*** The sensation you feel when successfully decapitate (or crush, depending on the weapon) your opponent in a single strike is very very very satisfying ***END OF THE NOT-SO-GRAPHIC CONTENT***  Last but not least, I hope the developer will add some new maps, weapons, or even class to make this game more interesting.",1,0

Hours upon hours of just using its multiplayer settings to hide from your friends in prop hunt, destryo some robots in MVM, or go all out capturing the flag and control points in multiplayer. Highly recommend. Despite some very questionable updates and the community belief that Valve just dont really care about this game anymore, after so many years I still find myself popping into a quick match and having some fun. The layout and feel of the game may have changed. But community servers keep the spirit alive.",1,0

8850,BioShock 2,"Just finishd Minerva's Den and yeah that story really got me...  Bioshock 2 as a whole is solid. The actual playthrough was good, but not as thrilling as the original or Infinite. The story wasn't as engaging as the others, but the ending was really good. Minerva's Den was great though. A short DLC that you can spend a lot or a little time exploring. The MD story was very good and the ending was also great. If you liked the original or Infinite, I'd recommend spending some time with this one and the DLC. Just keep your expectations grounded. My main suggestion though is save often. It does crash a lot on PC, which can be really frustrating at times. But if you save reguarly, it isn't too terrible. Still worth a playthrough.",1,0

41070,Serious Sam 3: BFE,"I wanted to love this game because the earlier Serious Sam's were some of our favorite - but couldn't. This one didn't have the humor or the gameplay. It looked like they were short on time and threw Serious Sam into some different half made game. The main melee attack monster is easier to kill (by popping it's eye out) than counterknifing in battlefield 4. The movement is awkward, and where are all the amusing traps from the past games?  The opening helicopter scene at the beginning is just so generic and bad you know your in for dissappointment. There are 3 enthusiastic Serious Sam players in our house, and all 3 give this an enthusiastic thumbs down. So dissappointed.",-1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"It's a really good game that happens to be targeted by /v/ and the like. They have no real reason to hate it but they've latched onto 'punishing' the developers for DLC with bad reviews. I don't like paid DLC but this game doesn't screw you with the DLC, it's purely optional and adds nothing but cosmetics to the game. The reviews for this game would be great if they just wouldn't allow alpha and beta testers, who aren't even playing the game, to review. Just look at the other reviews.

314030,Guilty Gear X2 #Reload,"A decent port of an obscured version of Guilty Gear XX nobody asked for. That said it works and its cool to have. I never played it way back when because cabs for it happened to be rare at the time and due to a deal the home version was apparently Xbox only. That said it may feel pointless with Accent Plus R being a thing and I say otherwise.  It is an alright port and a great deal easier to get into than later versions, not much but something. I would like to see it return to the Steam store and sadly I do not see that happening.  That's pretty much the review. If by any chance you are a newer fighting game fan or a member of the FGC just new to Guilty Gear this and Xrd may be kinder options to you. That's about all I can say.",1,0

238750,Might & Magic X - Legacy ,"I had been a massive fan of the Might &amp; Magic franchise when I was younger, and had been disappointed by the Might &amp; Magic 9. After hearing that they were going to try and create M&amp;M 10 with a retro feel I was hoping that they would rekindle some of the spark that M&amp;M 1 – M&amp;M 8 had.  Unfortunately, this had been another disappointment due to poor and confusing combat/spell systems, character development that is quite unforgiving and leaves me feeling that choice is an illusion and to get anywhere in the game you need a specific build of character.  I felt the limiting of classes to race and the extremely limited choice in character appearance was unnecessary and made the options you had to build a unique character even more obvious. The story telling had been weak and had not been focused on delivering short, clear and easy to follow story line.  I struggle to find any saving graces for the series, except the desire to continue the series. In conclusion I wouldn’t recommend this game to any fan of the original Might &amp; Magic series.

234630,Project CARS,"I intially backed Project Cars through their WMD platform as a team member as I enjoyed Shift 2 &amp; was hoping for something similar to Forza or GT on PC but more of a sim. So I was disappointed when the development shifted towards what so many racing sims on PC are, a non car customisable, choose your racing car sim. After becoming bored with the prebuilds I abandoned the forums &amp; discovered on release that instead of receiving a copy of the game as initially promised there was a 50% off coupon in my Steam inventory. Thankfully after a few months the backers received payments from sales but as I was still disappointed from not receiving the game I avoided it until Vive support was added.  Now being one of the few racing games to support the Vive I've been enjoying the game. Racing sims are hugely improved with VR, the ability to judge distances and being able to see elevation changes, just the immersion it offers.  It's worth picking up if you have a Vive, but I won't be backing Project Cars 2.",1,1

242050,Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag,"Never really got into the original Assassin's Creed or any of its sequels, but when I heard about this I put it on my wishlist and waited for it to come up on a steam sale. Got it in the June sale and it's one of the few games that I've paid $35 for and gotten my moneys worth out of.  Great game with great graphics even on my GTX 580 and an engaging story, although I thought the out of animus stuff was a bit weak (or at least not to my tastes). Well worth putting up with uplay for and I'm now actually looking forward to Unity when it comes out. Only downsides I really found with the game were the few glitches/bugs here and there (although nothing gamebreaking) and that after playing 2/3rds of the way through the story the tail/hide missions did start getting a little stale. Ship combat is good fun, as is clearing the decks with sword/guns whilst boarding and little things like the legendary ships and the diving sections were nice bonuses. Definitely recommend getting it if you even remotely like pirate games and some plunderin'!",1,0

34410,Death to Spies: Moment of Truth,"You play a Soviet counter-intelligence officer during World War II and your job is to infiltrate the Nazis, steal secrets, kill certain individuals and help dismantle the enemy from the inside.  I'm still in the process of playing this game and I love it. It's incredibly difficult at times as the enemy AI is pretty smart and will recognize odd behavior (which can vary depending on which uniform you've disguised yourself in). This is a game that takes stealthy undercover spy work very seriously. If you run-and-gun, you're as good as dead.  The best part is that you're free to complete your objectives however you see fit! Say there's a high ranking Nazi official you've got to assassinate. Do you want to plant explosives on the runway so his plane explodes when he lands or do you want to impersonate an SS officer, get the official alone and stab him? How about take him out from a distance with a sniper rifle? Those options (and tons more) are available.",1,0
99810,Bulletstorm,"I snagged this today on the Steam Holiday Sale. No problems downloading, activating and playing. I only played it for 25 minutes. But Really like it. It will get a serious worout.

But plays flawlessly in single player and multiplayer. After I get some SP experience with it. I'd love to get some multiplayer reps going. So stay tuned. Great shooter so far.",1,0
214340,Deponia,"For a game about garbage, it certainly isn't trash.  Wow!   I played Deponia like I was watching a movie, beating it in the span of one day. I was so into it I even 100%ed the game too (that Droggeljug achievement though, XD). While this may not be the best way to play games, I still found it a fun enough experience to commit to completing it over the course of most of a day off (no regrets)!  Just a quick recommendation, don't be afraid to use a guide with this game. Some of the puzzles are pretty brutal and take place over a couple different areas. This isn't to say the game is unreasonable, all the puzzles are logical, but it's easy to make only a cursory look-over of an area and end up spending an unnecessary half-hour looking in other places for a small, yet important item. You can only have so much free time (cough, cough). Plus it's less satisfying to when you solve one of these 'puzzles' making you think 'What? That was the solution?' rather than 'Yay, me and my smartness figured things out!'.  Either way, this game is an engaging point-and-click adventure with a sense of prominent humor and an expansive story that goes through 2 more games. Its world and environments are very stylistic, well-contrasted and full of awesome characters (that I hope to be seeing again in the next couple installments).  Do yourself a huge favor and at least try the demo because Deponia is definitely worth a buy!",1,0

Now that I upgraded to a 1440p monitor in 2016, I'm playing through the main game again. For a Direct X 10 game it's visually stunning, I love the steven kingesque story. Originally Alan Wake was going to be released on PC in 2010, I think it's annoying Microsoft made it an Xbox 360 exclusive for two years, but that version was pretty good too. If it takes an extra two years to polish the game I think they should, Alan Wake is one of the best games I've ever played.",1,0

377840,FINAL FANTASY IX,"I'm really enjoying the game so far. While it's just the fact my computer is a bit meh, I get lag on the FMV's, I can skip them and just continue with my game. Chocobo Hot and Cold still owns my soul as it always did before. Now onto my impressions. I'm very impressed with how the game looks. The backgrounds don't look awkward despite the new retextures of the characters, and I mean every character has been updated. Even the moogles look like they're fuzzy now. There are nice boosts that can be turned on and off if needed. In order to enjoy the game as its intended, I'd just use them when you're level grinding, and if you find the music repetitive while doing the grinding, you can turn the sound off and just put on your own music. Still as far as I've played this game is very faithful to the original, and it's been sorely missed. If you haven't tried it, I would STRONGLY reccomend this version over the psn version. The psn version is not optimized for widescreen tv's so it looks extremely pixely and does not do the game justice.",1,0

205950,Jet Set Radio,"Not quite sure what to make of this. Can't seem to get the hang of the controls. Granted, it's from a different era, but I have to wonder if something got lost in the process of porting it to the PC. The funky cheerful dystopia of Japanese indie rock punk skater living is more fun to watch in anime, or imagine in art, than to actually play in this game.  So, it's a mild recommend, 5-6 out of 10, as a playable music video. Kinda frustrating as a game. I want to say the learning curve and rewards for progress are better in early Tony Hawk skating games.  Update: I changed my mind. I had to put this down as a not-recommend to balance out all the cultishly positive reviews. It's not nearly as good as the 90+ percent approval that it's getting on Steam. Again, it seems to have benefitted a lot from nostalgia, but it doesn't hold up today.  Does anyone know if it's actually fun to hang out with Japanese skater punks? Anyone?",-1,1

17450,Dragon Age: Origins,"There are RPGs that draw you inside their own unique world, there are RPGs that feel boring and colourless... and there are RPGs that could almost provide the perfect roleplaying experience, if only their gameplay wasn't that dreadful.  Dragon Age: Origins belongs into the latter category. Indeed the storyline is far from new and largely inspired by the classic 'Humans, Dwarfs-living-in caves, elves-living-in-forests' scenario. The idea of a dark threat lingering in the depths, waiting to eradicate the known world is also nothing new in the RPG world. Dragon Age: Origins however manages to put a decent emphasis on the roleplay part. The fact that your possible dialogue options merely consist of the standard 3 ones (polite, not interested and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) does come as a little off, though.  Yet, I do not recommend this game and that is because of the gameplay. Unfortunately, DA:Os story just isn't good enough to turn it into an 'interactive-movie' kind of game. Therefore, the game has to rely on decent gameplay features such as world connection, quality of travel and most importantly battle mechanics. It is these features that take away the fun, in my opinion. The world is not open, but divided into towns and outposts with 'level-like' areas connected to them. The battle mechanics rely on you pausing the game and giving 10 different orders before you start the fight and probably fail due to someone not being healed quickly enough. Even repeatedly pushing an attack button is more fun than this approach Bioware has taken to the game.",-1,0

And here is why:  -There are 'special' Zombies similar to left 4 deads playable zombies (hunter, tank, boomer) that make the game unneccesary harder than it already is and take away from the the walking dead zombies feeling.  -There are set Buildings out of wich you are able to make a homebase and there are only a handfull of them around the  whole map and on top of that for some you HAVE to have enough survivors in your group to be able to move in  -No Roaming survivors only stationary groups you can visit and do stuff for them.  -No Bandits, you will never get attacked by bandits neither your base nor in the map somewhere.  -Wierd Controls  -No firstperson mode  i personaly dont recommend this game but that doesnt mean that it is a bad game. it leaves much to be desired but it is a step in the right direction on the road to a perfect Zombie apocalypse feeling.",-1,0

It can get both repetitive and grindy after a while, making you not want to go back at times... but if you follow a pattern and take your time, you'll probably do faster and better than I did as the game is structured to help you ease your way to Level 100 in no time.   The worst part is that the game doesn't really satisfy/reward you for levelling up/unlocking achievements other than levelling up and unlocking achievements.

391540,Undertale,"Okay, first off; yes, you should play it. Gameplay is solid, characters are charming, humor is funny, and I believe a good amount of people will enjoy it.  Second and more importantly, as I went along my fanboying craze about this game, I started to realize I did a disservice to some friends for recommending they play in THIS SPECIFIC WAY. I got legitimately upset by going against the grain because I felt like there was only one real way to experience it. I hated that in hindsight, but I understand why I did.   And that's when I realized the beauty of this game. If you do it the way you want, you'll get what amounts to a game that is set to your ideal play. You get that experience. That is yours.   Undertale is a game that adapts to YOUR playstyle in a way that is subtle and effective. You play the game and think 'I wonder what would have happened if I did this instead?'. It doesn't go right up to you after a decision and outline what you did and how it changes the ending. You have to wait until later to really get the gist of what you did and how it changes things. Still, that sense of mystery creates curiosity, especially considering how charming the characters all in general.  That curiosity is a huge aspect to this game. It makes the alternative more powerful if you play it again, even if the alternative is distasteful to you. You wonder what would happen if you made a different choice here. You experiment with that. And the game rewards that, in its own way.  If you get this game, try and play it the way you want first. There is no 'strong' ending. There is no 'weak' ending. There is only your first ending, and where you want to go from there. Play it how you would first and enjoy it. Then dig deeper. I promise that curiosity will be rewarded greatly.",1,0

219740,Don't Starve,"Don't Starve is...It's really amazing, to be simple about it. It's one of those games that can make you as angry as you've ever been without driving you away. I'll go ahead and get to the point.  Don't Starve in and of itself is a great concept, simple at face but so very intricate and complex in the inner mechanisms. You'll find yourself dying multiple times due to your sheer overconfidence, feeling like you've judged the situation properly but dying due to your own malfunctions. There's so much to do, so many different ways to survive, and a huge open world that's generated differently each time in front of you. You can change and edit the world you wish to explore to your own standards, which is amazing.   The crafting mechanic is really well made and I love that you have to build higher tiers to get better things. The sanity is so easily overlooked until the moment when everything starts going grey and the monsters from your mind start trying to murder you. There's so much in this game, and it's all really, really wonderful. 10/10 ",1,0
209870,Blacklight: Retribution,"I see a lot of negative reviews from long time players. Dont let them put you off, this is a truly awesome game! Blacklight recently recieved a MASSIVE patch, which changed weapon balance and recoil dramaticly. The developers are closely watching community reaction to this and this may be patched. Weapon balance is still pretty good and the starting weapon, the default AR, is still one of the strongest weapons around. Which brings me to my next point this game is not pay to win all guns, gun parts, depot loadouts, and armour are all unlockable by in game currency. Most of these though are behind a level wall which you can use real money to unlock. Most camos and emotes and heroes are only unlocked by real money.

Campaign seems like it is done well. On lower levels you can storm through anything, but later levels, whenever you take out an enemy structure, another structure starts puts out more enemies, which means their pathing is different, so you have to figure out how to outflank them again.

200710,Torchlight II,"Best ARPG I've played to date. Why?  - Casual gamer Friendly!  - Although there is, what may seem at first, a limited number of classes the skill selection makes for at least 3 or 4 different sub-variations for each class. Replay value is great, although leveling is a test of patience. Capping taking roughly 2 complete playthroughs.  - Graphics are not as hard on the average CPU that us mortals can afford. I prefer stylized graphics over realistic graphics because they are never out of style or look dated like most other 3D games.  - It offers an Endgame consisting of Mapworks, a tool that allows you to run random dungeons of a level of your choosing (up to 105), and Tarroch's Tomb, a relentless 10 wave gauntlet that drops loot every wave you beat but disappears if you die (Wave 1 comprised of lvl 100 enemies and wave 10 of lvl 199 enemies).  - The loot system actually feels FAIR!!! *coughs* Diablo III *coughs*  - Moddability adds heaps to the game including a difficulty increase and class changes that increase replay value. Downside is modded game saves are different than stock and you can only play with people that have the same mods. Items can not be crossed from modded to unmodded.  - If you get bored or just want to test limits you can duplicate items for money or utility by using a stash and save file manuever. You could also use console to spawn items but you will be labeled as a cheater. The ability to do these cheats adds a lot to the experienced of a gamer that is NOT HARDCORE. Casual gamers need to be catered to too.  The only real downside I found was the relentlessness when making ability choices.  MARK MY WORDS: You cannot respec more than the last 3 abilities you leveled or chose. This means you must level up a character from scratch to try a different build and will probably have to make 2 almost identical characters to fix a stupid choice mistake you made on your first try at a class. Some people love this feature but I believe it would be better if you could just have 2 sub-class slots like you have in WoW or if you could get an option to reset points after completing the game. Just my 2 cents.  Please buy this and enjoy.",1,0

I had some great times with this game on Xbox 360, and now I can do it all over again with a superior version! The PC version runs great, controls with a Keyboard/Mouse, and has native xbox 360 controller support if you want it. Options are minimal, but still much better than console.  How is it? Here's an example: Once I was doing nothing more than walking down a hallway in an empty building, with no enemy in sight. My character started talking about his balls in a manner that seemed to be instucting someone on how to pleasure them with... extreme dedication and vulgarity. It was the most random thing that ever happened me in a game. It was hilarious, I was actually in tears laughing. Then I found some dudes and stabbed them many times. There was much death and fun. Rinse and repeat, mix it up a little with guns and such.  If you are like me and have a special place for the (excuse the cliche') 'So bad it's good' type of game, then Rogue Warrior is the golded turd you have been waiting for! You will be wading up to your knees in stealth violence, all while hearing the most insane &amp; horrible, yet perfect voice over a game has ever had,   Buy this game, or you hate yourself, and so does Richard Marcinko, and he will come and murder you with his balls.",1,0
328730,Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey,Very enjoyable game. Use words to damage monsters. It has light RPG elements to it to build your character to do more damage/take less damage. There are numerous combinations to use in the game thereby offering a fairly rich variety of things to try. The equipment and the upgrades do make a material difference as to whether you'll win a level. And the part I like is that you can pretty much build any combination and still win (which cannot be said for quite a few RPGs which are very equipment centric).   The achievements can all be reasonably accomplished. I completed all the levels and most achievements in one play through without paying too much attention to them. The last few took a bit of grinding. The 3000 words took a lot of grinding.   My playing time is a fairly accurate reflection of one play through and the grinding to get to 3000 words. For a few bucks definitely worth it if you like word games.,1,0

No race campaign mode, just a chain of random events where you can jump through.  There is no radar, minimap or track info.. you need to know the tracks. You can view back but ( at least for me ) the rear view is delayed on pushing the key and there is delay on releasing the key. Very annoying while driving.  The game doesn't show you your speed or RPM. I'm just missing this.  There are many cars to unlock.. and then you need to buy them ( which is somehow expensive ). But if you finished one event.. you can play it again.. but you don't get more money for it. You can upgrade your cars which is expensive too.

If you never played other Cities XL games, then it may be worth it, but if you played the previous games theres nothing new to see here, even if its 50% off.",-1,0

261640,Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel,"Alright so a lot of people kind of hated my review so I thought I would revamp it a bit.  Borderlands The Pre-Sequel is truly a 1 of a kind game. It mixes RPG with suprisingly funny humor and characters you just can NOT hate, with a character selection which is so hard to choose from this game had me at a crossroads at night thinking, Clap-Trap or Nisha. This game is an amazing 'pre-sequel' to Borderlands 2, although if you haven't played Borderlands 2 I HIGHLY recommend you play it before you even begin to look at this game.  Pros:  &gt; No gravity? Ummmm HELL YEAH! Having no gravity on the moon is simply amazing. It makes you feel like you own the world when you are in a double jump for example, or just bouncing off of an enemy just for the lols!  &gt;Side missions. Right off the bat there are TONS of side missions to do. If you are a side mission fanatic (like me) then BLPS is where you want to be.  &gt;Dialogue. Hehehehehe, is me basically everytime Jack or some other characters smart off to my character and just hearing the response makes it even more hilarious!  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Cons:  &gt;Combat. I just want to start off by saying that it may just be me that is having this issue, I haven't looked into it deeply enough yet to be sure. Close combat with BLPS is sort of tricky, when an enemy gets closer it seems as if you can't shoot as fast, if he is right up on you... you would be lucky to get in 2 shots before he killed you.  &gt;Rendering issues. My friend and I observed that there are a few rendering bugs but none that would make the game too too difficult to play. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I will update my review as I have played more so yeah!",1,0

17470,Dead Space,"One of the most challenging games I've played to date, and yet one of the most fun. Dead Space sucessfully combines the horror element of a game with an excellent storyline. It makes you feel like you are completely alone, even though you've got friends talking to you over the radio. And unlike games like Amnesia and Penumbra, it doesn't warn you when there's a monster nearby, so you get a heck of a surprise. And ammo is extremely limited, so you can't just blast through the levels. All of these elements combined actually guide the player to look at their surroundings, which adds even more to the horror atmosphere. Pretty much the only thing I'd change is the level guide that tells you where to go. It would be a bit more fun and challenging if you had to figure out where to go next on your own.",1,0

8930,Sid Meier's Civilization V,"Between the original version, the Gods and Kings expansion, and now Brave new World, I've accumulated 500 hours of gameplay, and it doesn't look like that's stopping any time soon. By itself, Civ V is one of the best strategy games I've ever played; with the right mods (of which there are plenty), it becomes truly addictive. Generally, one of my biggest gripes with empire-building games is that your empire supports your military conquests. In CiV, your military supports your empire. I have maybe one game in ten where I'll initiate a war; most of the time, I'm way too busy creating the most dominant empire in the land. And it varies every time: right now I'm pushing a game where my religion covered half the globe; the game before that, my scientific accomplishments were second to none. Every game is different; if you play the same way every time, you're not going to get far. I can't emphasize enough how important it is to get both expansion packs. Gods and Kings was praised for adding the religion mechanic, but its primary benefit is a major revamp of the combat system and technology tree that makes both of them so much more neat and logical. Brave New World drastically alters both the culture and the diplomacy victories, and both are for the better, forcing you to put effort into those victories through the whole game. And get mods. I can't tell you which ones to get, but absolutely get some. As you play the game, you'll start to notice little things you wish it did differently. And 90% of the time, someone's already made a mod to fix that. I'm playing with over a dozen right now. Some make wonders more usable, some add more luxury resources or religions, one of them makes scouts usable past the medieval era and another removes the cap on XP you can get from barbarians, and a whole mess more. I've actually reached a point where I'm mixing and matching my mods based on what type of game I'm trying to run. This game will very likely become my #1 most played game, and pretty much the only thing that's going to stop me from accumulating 1,000 hours in it is Life. Put this game on your wishlist, pick up the expansion packs during steam sales, and get addicted.",1,0

Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien,"I'll better review this game before my aggravation caused by the difficulty of the last few levels kill off any objectivity remaining.   'This game is best played using a controller'.   Then why the helvede is there no support for my (relatively) old Logitech Rumblepad 2. Even tried binding the buttons to keyboard presses using the Logitech profiler software, but those petty tricks is no match for this game's stubbornness.  Anywho, onward and upwards with my trusty wired gaming keyboard. This proved less than optimal, as there's a really noticable input lag. I know it's part of the game design that you remember the pattern of the obstacles anyways, meaning that you should be able to simply adjust the timing of memorized keypresses. But under normal circumstances good reflexes can make up for what you forget - so NOT being able to do so in the very last stages of the game ups the difficulty A LOT.  Lower the difficulty to grandma mode you say? NEVAH!  The first 85% of the game is mostly smooth and enjoyable sailing, but the last parts had me yelling at the monitor. It didn't seem to mind though.  If it weren't for the aforementioned technical problems, I'd give this charming rythmic platformer a respectable 80%, but I can't justify more than 65%.   ",1,0

371660,Far Cry Primal,"OK OK. So, I spoke too soon (SEE BELOW). Anyone reading his, hang in there. As the game matures, the game gets better and the annoying factors are mitigated with the protagonist's (your) skill and resource development. And yes, there is even a quasi-story. I'm finally likin it... and totally impressed with the graphics/art-work etc. WOW!! So, I've changed my NO to a YES. HOWEVER, I am sticking with the CONS described below... ...bottom line: a little less killing and gore (of and by animals and humans) and a bit more strategy would have been good.   Far Cray Primal is a far cry from its predecessor Far Cry 4. It is like A BAD SEQUEL TO A GREAT MOVIE. The graphics are great. HOWEVER, there are too many negative aspects that RUIN THE FUN FACTOR: too much brainless, unnecessary, and random killing (Far Cry 4 was more than a mindless shooter); too many VERY annoying attacks by wild animals (if this were real life, you wouldn’t be able to take a crap without being bitten in the ♥♥♥ and the human species would never have survived); I never used fast travel in a game but now I need to (to get away from those pesky creatures… beautiful as they are – I wonder why I’m killing them at all); the gore is way over done; travelling from one place to another is frustrating because there are WAY TOO MANY predators (animal and human); oh ya, and my pack is full of meat and not enough arrows (hardwood hunting has become a bore). I could go on. JEERS to the testers. Whatever they were on, I DO NOT want to share. After loving Far Cry 4 from the start, I am disappointed.

363680,Battlefleet Gothic: Armada,"I don't really recommend this. It was billed as a RTS with an emphasis on the scale of the battles and ships. Of how customizable the ships are, and so on/so forth. Except there isn't any real scale to the battles, or depth to the mechanics, and the customizability is pretty limited(in campaign at least)  AI isn't very intelligent. Your ships will maneuver like idiots and ram eachother if you don't micromanage them, and often times their too slow to be able to catch anything thats gone out of range anyway.   As a whole, the game plays like Rebellion(really really old star wars turn based strategy) and you go into missions with your fleet a certain number of times per turn. The missions are either stupidly easy (protect the data, you just run for 2 minutes and then jump) Or stupidly impossible(prevent planetary bombardment? HA)   the missions themselves take 4-5 minutes usually, and thats if you get them right, there is no quicksave or quickload system, so you have to return to the main menu if ♥♥♥♥ is not going well to reload and try again.   There are many upgrades for your ships, however they're slight upgrades and you won't really see a major difference between a ship with an extra shield or one with armor piercing ammo.   Nitpicks everywhere. No fleet formations, no tactics for the ships other than attack or don't and which range. a frigate plays exactly the same as a battlecruiser. not to mention the low as ♥♥♥♥ unit cap the campaign limits you to.   The game also tends to crash on me. Though i've played 7 hours, I've managed to have it crash 4 times completely randomly. Usually in battles, but not consistantly.   Finally, i realize the universe of WH4k is supposed to be 'gothic' and i've even played other games before without a problem, but i can't help but be annoyed by the pompous cliche jackasses who are my characters 'superiors'",-1,0

238090,Sniper Elite 3,"I pre-purchsed Sniper Elite 3 as I had already bought Sniper Elite 2 + all the DLC's for SE2 and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the entire package. I'd gone through the campaign several times, mostly at Marksman level (my personal favourite - I enjoy lining the diamond up for a shot), but also at Sniper Elite, mostly for the achievement. Sniper Elite 2, after hundreds of hours playing time is still a game I like to 'dip back into'; play a particular level in a different way, setting myself a particular challenge or go for an obscure achievement, or just play for the extra points and pure pleasure of the graphics and settings. This cannot be said for all campaign WWII shooters, some can get very predictable and can only be played in a certain way which you will realise after only a couple of plays through, so I'm really pleased to be in the Sniper Elite camp. Sniper Elite 3 proved to be even more superior in all aspects than SE2. Once again, hundreds of hours into the game and I am still looking forward to playing each mission over and over again. Still finding areas of the maps I havent explored, and after maybe 5 times through I can honestly say each time has been a completely different experience. The only thing that will hold you back as you sneak through the North African settings will be your own imaginative methods and skills. The cam-kills never get dull for me, and being able to retain stealth while I systematically silence and destroy airfields/factory's/gun emplacements etc is truly satisfying. One (constructive) criticism is the subdued enemy response to my attacks. While it really is real fun to creep through missions sniping with sound cover or silently downing enemies as I tag and find them, sometimes it seems the realism is lost as after a short period of 'alertness', comrades of the dead just seem to resign themselves to the fact that the garrison (or whatever it is) they are stationed at is slowly but surely being annihilated. There is no heightened sense of alarm. It is possible to hide bodies, which is an amazing feature, but what with the enemy not seeming to care too much, after a minute or so, that another of their comrades has been found dead, there wasn't a great deal of incentive to use it for me. I won't comment on the MP as I haven't played it enough to appreciate it, but definitely from what I have played its all thumbs up from me. Atmospheric, tense and immersive, and definitely a game you will go back to over and over again. More Sniper Elite (4?) please : -)",1,0

240760,Wasteland 2,"the more I play the more I enjoy it. I dont get negativity except that its probably from add kids. The storys not that linear multiple ways to finish missions. But no real evil option for the end. at the end of the day your a ranger but how you help the rangers is up to you.  Comabt is cool, but a little over powered towards the end but I find that true with most RPGs, hell in F02 when I had a plasma rifle and power armor I was a walking god  I wish certain weapons made more sense especially heavy weapons and I would love body part targeting like fallout, but its no big deal.  I love the group banter, Ralphy is awesome even though he is a 13 year old kid who is slightly psychotic.  Theres a fair amount of work in the radio adds and for some reason I enjoy the samson and his book song.  But what made me say this is a clasic through and through was when you first get to seal beach. Mathias has a great sense of humor.  It defiantly has replay value as you get either be a fair ranger or super evil hard ♥♥♥.  tons of little things that are great, from finding et cartridges, getting stuck with a dog. I dont see why theres any negativity, if enojoy fallout 1+2 this is pretty solid, not as great as Fo2 with options, but F02 party system sucked donkeys. theres things about both games that were a little off but none of those distract from how great the game is.",1,0

24780,SimCity 4 Deluxe,"A decade old and still an absolutely fantastic game that doesn't look or feel even slightly dated.   If this was released today, it would be praised for its attention to detail and vast simulation improvements over the new Simcity (2013). Basically, this game is 1/4 of the price of the newest release, and CONSIDERABLY better.  Simulation is in-depth and chock full of charts, graphs, and data overlays. Build whole, huge regions of billions of sims, with cities all interconnected to form vast metropolises. Plot sizes are up to 16x larger than the newest Simcity (2013) and they directly border their neighbours, allowing you to build a large city over the course of several plots. Not only that, but when linked they can share demand and resources very easily.  In short - buy this.",1,0

375430,The Logomancer,"I honestly can't recommend this highly enough. Between the original premise, non-stock art assets and music, creative puzzles, better-than-average writing, competent dungeon design, and a decent chunk of optional content . . . this game is good. Really, really good.  The basic premise is that you finalize contracts for a company with people who can make permanent structures in the shared dreamscape that the people of this world visit in their sleep. Most things people create while sleeping vanish, but logomancers can create things that last, and other people can experience those things in their sleep, etc. So it's a skill in high demand. Anyway, you can do the bare minimum -- meet the local logomancer, 'test out' his latest dreamscape creation, get him to sign the contract, and then leave town. 2 or 3 hours, ending triggered, game over.  Or . . . you could visit the other townspeople, assist them with a number of side quests, visit other areas of the local dreamscape. As you do so, you'll occasionally come across various bits of weirdness that hint at a greater mystery. Needless to say, most of the optional content(to get the 'true ending') ties into this mystery, which you can in fact solve. And once you've done that, there's even a little bit of post-game content that gives you just a bit more information if you can beat its super bosses. The game took me about 23 hours to finish in its entirety(minus 1 super boss), so I'd guess there's at least 15 to 20 hours of content for most people.  As far as I can tell, no stock assets were used in this game. From the tiles to the sprites to the music, it's all unique. I'm not going to lie -- body proportions are weird, the colors can be very vivid and jarring, but . . . you can tell it was all done by the same person, so there's a consistency. Love it or hate it, you have to admire that someone went through the trouble of making their own stuff instead of using the RPG Maker stock art. And personally, I thought it all worked together really well once I got used to the style.  The battle system has some neat things going for it. Under the surface, it's pretty much what we're used to. Elemental and non-elemental attacks/defenses, health, magic points, various status effects, and the such. However, it's the trappings that make it so special! Instead of regular battles, you have conversations or debates. Your opponents in the waking world are other people, and in the dreamscape the foes take the form of abstract concepts, logical errors, grammatical errors, and the such. The 3 basic elements are ethos(ethical thinking), logos(rational thinking), and pathos(angry/emotional thinking), and manipulating and taking advantage of those states in order to do the most 'damage' makes up the basic layer of combat, and you gain access to a number of skills as you level up(or learn from books) that mix this up. I love that this game lets me drop ethical opponents with a Modus Ponens argument. That's just a bit of magic right there.  Not going to lie. There are some flaws. Getting some of the items necessary for the 'true ending' and the post-game content can be kind of maddening. Even if you pay careful attention to everything that's said or every note you read, stumbling across some of it seems to be just dumb luck. There are a couple walls you can walk through that I'm not sure how you're expected to find them; I got lucky and just stumbled on them, but I read that other people had a lot of trouble with them. And one of the superbosses is hiding in plain sight with nothing to indicate that you're about to fight something huge; nothing tips you off that it's not a normal enemy fight until it's too late, and you have to beat it and get its item drop in order to do the post-game content. And the water spine cave puzzle is just horrible -- I Googled the solution, and even seeing the explanations(it's a base-5 counting thing) didn't help; the picture you're supposed to decode to get the solution still makes no sense to me.  Also, another interesting thing just to illustrate how much work went into this -- you can't really sequence break. For example, there's a 'find the journal' side quest at one point. You can talk to A, then B, then go to X, read D, then go to Y and solve puzzle Z to find the journal. Or . . . you can go straight to the puzzle, get the journal, and return it to A without breaking anything at all. And that's just one example. This game really encourages you to explore, and it doesn't punish you(except perhaps by you running into enemies you're not strong enough for yet) for doing so. Go ahead. Do some things out of the normal order. The game can take it. Sometimes doing things in the 'wrong' order gets you slightly different dialogue, too. For another example, there is a little time at the beginning of the game when you only have 2 party members. The 3rd joins you very soon if you follow the main story path, but you can wander around and do a number of things before getting her to join you, and the dialogue will be a little different than if you'd had her in your party while doing those same things.  All things considered, I give it a solid 8 out of 10. It could have been darn near perfect, but a couple non-game-breaking bugs and the obtuseness of certain things I mentioned above take their toll. Still, all in all, a highly recommended experience.",1,0
362680,Fran Bow,"Fran Bow is a very interesting take on what mental illness looks like to someone going through it from severe trauma of losing thos most precious to you. It also delves into the fantasy of what may be running though that person's mind as they live out their life hallucinating what may or may not be real to them.

360430,Mafia III: Definitive Edition,"Alright. So i have decided to not play this game past 2 hours just in case this fps fix ever gets released. And if it does, i want to have 1 hour left to test it. So here is my thoughts on the game after playing the first 2 missions, and i took the time to get out of my car and look at some textures, some animations, and stuff like that. Just to get a quick first impression of what this game is.  I run GTX 1080 rig with the lastest nVidia drivers, basically a PC that runs games like GTA V &amp; The Division all maxed out in over 60fps.  The first thing i notice is that this game can not run in window borderless, it's either windowed or fullscreen, which is the second hint that this company had no plans of making a good pc version of this game, the first hint was the fps cap. Neither 2k or Hangar13 said anything about a fps cap, until the game was released, when pc gamer wrote an article on it. Then the popular youtuber totalbiscuit started asking questions, and that's when 2k made a statement.  This statement does not specify anything other than that they know the game is running in 30 fps and that higher fps will come soon.  They do not say how many fps or what soon means . But it is likely they are trying to keep people playing and hoping, so that they pass their 2 hour steam refund mark.  It makes absolutely no sense to release a game in this state if they knew how to avoid it. No sense at all. So i will take all they say with a few hundred grains of salt.  Releasing a game to reviewers, the very people that are there to critizise your product, in a state that, in their words, will be fixed 'very soon'. Yeah right.. Very logical.   One thing that does make sense however is why this game had a review embargo.  TBH this game seems unfinished. The graphics looks like they are at least 5 years old. The city and the scale looks really good, but it looks like the entire game is upscaled.  This is a game that is not worth the price they are currently asking , not even close. I will put a hold on my refund atm, and see if a fix will arrive, but for those of you who are on the fence about buying this game, i would wait. It is a bad pc port, almost without any work gone into it.  In short:   +Narrative and story seems good +Absolutely incredible soundtrack  -Can't bind extra mouse buttons to anything -Rear view mirror has terrible draw distance -30 fps cap -Really low res textures all over the place -Looks like upscaled graphics -Horrible shadow draw distance on some objects   This is what i can remember at the top of my head. This is not worthy of a triple A PC release. Even if the game was running at 60fps, this does not look like a PC game with this price tag. So wait until it's on at least 50% sale.  It saddens me a bit to say this, because i had hopes for this game, i added it to my wishlist last December. And was looking forward to enjoying this game for the next few weeks until civilization VI releases. If it wasn't for the steam refund system, i would have felt robbed right now.  TBH this game has issues i don't think they will fix anytime soon, there will be plenty of fanboys saying i'm wrong about this, that a fix is just around the corner. But i can't see it happening. Maybe a 60fps fix is coming within the next week or so, maybe 2 weeks. But that will still make the game look washed out.  This review might change completely if they do something drastic.    EDIT:   Thanks to user :  Butcher of Blaviken , i'm now adding some information to this review. After i wrote this review, 2K released another statement which reads:   We currently have a patch running here at the studio that includes 30, 60, and unlimited frames-per-second options in the video menu, among other improvements for the PC version of Mafia III. We re verifying the patch now to ensure everything is working as expected. If everything goes well, we expect the update to go live this weekend.     EDIT 2:   This game is much worse than i thought. I have seen a lot of videos today showing hundreds of serious bugs and glitches. From the looks of it, this game is far worse than watch_dogs was/is.  So now i have absolutely no hope left that this game will ever be fixed, if you want to see, just search for 'Let's Break the Mafia 3 AI' &amp; 'mafia 3 gameplay bugs', and stuff like that on google and youtube and a lot of videos will show you how bad this game really is.  So i just refunded it. This is totally unacceptable, and 2K should have known better. And i usually defend 2K as they release a lot of quality content. But this is the first title made by Hangar13, and i can safely say they were not up for the task.",-1,1

383870,Firewatch,"Firewatch is a game that sold itself to me primarily on the amazing aesthetics, and I ended up going into it almost entirely blind. This turned out to be a furtunate decision, and I thoroughly enjoyed playing it over a bit less than 4 hours, having had few expectations going in. And for the first time in a long time, I did another playthrough of a game very shortly after finishing it (clocking in another 3 hours), in order to see what I had missed the first time around.  Briefly, Firewatch is a narrative game centering around two people, one of whom is the protagonist, Henry, who has taken the job to monitor for the presence of fires in the Shoshone National Forest, from atop a guard tower. The main gameplay element, and the major draw, is the radio that Henry carries during his duties, which connects him with the second major character, his supervisor Delilah. Delilah not only gives Henry tasks to complete, typically involving longer or short trips into the wilderness, but also grows to be a close and familiar presence to both Henry and the player, and their interactions form the backbone of the game. During their interactions, the player has the option of choosing between various responses, or even no response, shaping the narrative between the two. I found this aspect of the game to be incredibly well done, thanks to a great script and the fantastic voice acting performed for both characters. The game is further underlined by an incredible soundtrack, which I found to fit the story and the setting very well, and which makes for great listening on its own.  However, as the narrative is the backbone of the game, more gamey elements take a backseat. There are very minor puzzle elements, and some minor 'collectibles' which allow you to learn about some secondary characters, but these take the back-seat to the narrative between Henry and Delilah. Fortunately, I would argue, as the game would not have been any better in my eyes had it included an abundance of such elements. If I have to make one criticism, it would be that the game could have benefitted from a bit more time spent fleshing out the relationship between Delilah and Henry, before the plot gains steam.  Finally, while some were apparently disappointed by the ending, I will say that I am not among those. In fact, now that I know the full scope of the story, I was eager to play the game again, to reshape the narrative (in some ways) compared to my last play-through, and to see what hints, clues, and   turtles   I missed the first time around. Indeed, playing the game again provided answers to several questions that I had missed during my first playthrough, and revealed additional background information thanks to different dialogue choices, though I did find that this also revealed that certain parts of the conversation were not as flexible as I had hoped. Still, for me, both the game and the soundtrack was worth every cent, and worth playing through twice.   A final recommendation before I finish: By default the game will show your exact location on the map, and pop up notifications when your objective changes. It is, however, possible to turn both of these features off, and I would strongly urge anyone playing Firewatch to do so, as this makes for a much more immersive experience. Furthermore, I would also recommend playing with head-phones, to enhance the already great sound-design, both in terms of the environmental audio and the music.",1,0

321960,Might & Magic Heroes VII ,"I really wanted to like this game, I don't mind the slow AI, Even tough its at the same quality of Heroes 2 or 3.. the clunky animations or re used models. animation and modelling cost a lot of money to do, and Im guessing the game did not have a high budget. or all the money went into making a map maker that can make random 3d maps. I remember when heroes VI came out and they said they couldn't make a 3d map maker, it would be to dificult and to expensive, turns out they where right on the expensive part, as the game is severly lacking.   AI could be patched later, but the fact that so many champaign games have gamebreaking bugs in them, at launch is rediculus. Those are mostly fixed now, but what really breakes it for me is the out of sync errors on multiplayer, even over a LAN network whitout simultainius turns and whitout spectateing combats I can never get a game to last longer then 2 weeks if im LUCKY.   I like the new flanking mechanics, but I dont like the change to warcries, or the fact that you can't make a custom hero anymore like you could in VI. That was cool.  its been a month, some of the gamebreaking single player bugs have been fixed, but there is still some memory leaking bugs and the out of syncadge making it unplayable.   Im severly disapointed whit the lack of contact they have had with the comunity so far and the sorry state the game came out in, and still is for many people.   I'll return in half a year or so to see if its finaly fixed. And maybe then it will be playable enough that i can see if it is at all balanced.",-1,1

29900,Dark Sector,"Difficult (almost no modern hand-holding and no difficulty adjustment), a little scary, and full of mystery, Dark Sector is a brutal 3rd-person shooter with a twist... your character (Hayden Tenno) is slowly being transformed into a monster by a strange alien virus. The more of a 'monster' you become, the more 'human' you become (well, despite all the brutality he must partake in to survive). Tenno also gets to use an awesome pinwheel of death that grows out of his hand, blatantly ripped off of the cult 80's sci-fi/fantasy film 'Krull', name and all (the 'Glaive'). Graphics are great, soundtrack is a bit repetitive but great, Tenno's powers become more awesome as you progress, and the whole affair serves as a prequel of sorts to 'Warframe' (I played Dark Sector first, way back in 2007 on my Xbox 360, so I was drooling over Warframe when it first came out on PC). What's not to like? Er, other than the aspect ratio being a little screwy on widescreen resolutions.",1,0

275850,No Man's Sky,"Don't give Sean Murray your money. The game is Minecraft alpha with a nice texture pack. Buy Minecraft instead.   The beginning is simple enough. Fix your ship, power it up, explore the skies. And then the problems arise. There is no real objective and the 12983709817243987234 planets they could create are boring. creatures are scarce, resources are limited and inventory is ALWAYS a problem. some things stack for convenience, other don't jsut to annoy you. You can't automate obvious and essential tasks, such as powering up your environmental suit. So every 30 mins ro so, you will open your inventory, scroll throughy our mods to your survival module, and feed it carbon or some other element you have thousands of. But that's it. Name things, learn languages (3), and explore.   Very, very seriously, buy minecraft. not NMS. it's overpriced, it's barren, it doesn't have multiplayer, it fails to revolutionize anything and fails to even work out basic elements properly.  Don't buy it. Ever.",-1,0

245620,Tropico 5,"Hey - crapola alert! - its a great game and all that - but, I just feel like I've wasted my time in the game. 2.9 hours wasted..   I started in tutorial mode and was enjoying my game, I had plantations for every crop, had built a catholic mission as soon as I could and had 5 military towers and a military base. I was even sending out troops on recon missions.  Looking forward to opening up the rest of the game, I already had tenaments and houses opened and had built several tenaments and mansions and houses. I had a second mine going, a clinic, casino, two restaurantes, tobacco and textile factory, Two lumber mills and two logging production units, parks and whole load of housing built as well as a police station and fishing dock. I had a power plant and was sending out experdition to get the ancient ruins discovered.  Then I was amazed to get warings in the tutorial about trades notices and other edicts. When my game came back into play, I had lost everything - I have the save to prove it, but each time I load it, - the tutorial interrupts my game.   I just wish they had told me this would happen at the start. If you know how to play this game as do I, my advice would be to start in normal mode- not tutorial mode.   I am now really dismayed at the thought of having to do all that again - it has just spoilt my enjoyment of the game.   Damn the Tropico devs for not letting you continue your game to normal play after starting in the tutorial mode. I don't think I have the energy to contiue playing. Really peed off.   It will be some time and I will have to be bored s*** less before I decide to waste any more of my life and leisure time on this game.",-1,0

For example, complete the game without buying anything in the shop, or visit both secret locations in one run and then complete the game. Makes for quite a challenge.

212050,Resonance,"This game has its nice moments and it is unfortunate I have only thumb up or thumb down as a rating.

412540,The Minotaur," Thank you to the developers for generously supplying me with a review key.  ---    The Minotaur  is a small puzzle-solving coffee break game, with the added bonus of local couch play.  While there are a few different modes such as endless and time-attack, the fairly simple puzzle solving mechanic does not change drastically throughout.  Essentially, you push blocks in order to 'squish' or 'entrap' minotaurs.  The minotaurs have a few variants, but could definately use more.   Pros:  +Music and artwork is very nice +Navigating the menus in-game with the character always works out well IMO +While the modes do not differ greatly, they give options +Multiplayer works great, with solid controller support   Cons:  -As I am playing this, I often wonder if it would have been better off being strictly turn-based (ie. I move 1 turn, and then the minotaurs get 1 turn, repeat). As it stands, the minotaurs move in real-time, which leaves me thinking less and making hasty moves. Would more strategy be good here? -The base mechanic is fine, but definately not enough to get me addicted. Its been done one-too-many times before. -Powerups scattered on the board would surely add entertainment value. Having players scramble for things that make the game easier or harder would be great.  -Surely something that could be fixed - sometimes you spawn with an enemy literally right next to you and its insta-death. No big deal, since death doesn't mean much, but this should be fixed. -I find trying to achieve a certain score to be fairly boring and meaningless. Maybe give me meta-game unlocks? How about character color/skin customization?   Look, this is not a fail by any means. I mean this is a great start for this developement team. As I always ask: would I recommend it to my friends to run out and spend their hard-earned money? No.  I'd keep this developement team on my radar, because there is real potential - and they have shown that they can deliver a final, stable, product. Best of luck to them with this, and future work.",-1,1

Now, let's get this clear, If you're a minecraft player and you're expecting a minecraft game but 2D You will most likely hate this game. If you're a person who likes Exploring and going to a boss and getting your ♥♥♥ whupped and then working to get stronger and stronger then going to that boss and shoving his hand straight up his ♥♥♥ with Crafting elements that pretty much follow Minecraft's Console crafting, You will love the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game. [No spoilers for players who haven't played]  Pros  Game's pretty simple to start out with, easy for newer players to get into it.  The game is constantly updating so any game-breaking bug will probably be fixed within the week and is also still getting lots of new stuff.  The worlds are randomly generated so, it literally is impossible to have 2 worlds that have the exact same biomes in the exact same places.  There's good Co-op with friends and works very solidly, so playing with friends is awwweeesssooooome.  Bosses are very challenging and if you don't come prepared, you will die. A lot.  Every boss is very different both in how it is summoned and how it is fought.  Every ENEMY is very different in which there are Zombies which are slow enemies who can and Will attack you at anytime he see's you while there are some more enemies like the Floating Eye which will take a good angle you can't see it from and rush you to deal quite a bit of damage and there's enough variance in all enemies they never get boring to look at.  The game has Tons of replayability.  The game encourages you to go mining and exploring, in fact there are many bosses that are only found by exploring the world around you.  Cons:  The community isn't exactly the most perfect thing, and most of the time it's best just playing with a group of friends.  There is a lot of work to get from the early stages to the game to the full experience, Before you kill a certain boss you are in pretty much the tutorial world and you can get stuck.  If you're new, the wiki will be a Nessisary.  There are many items, but also very complicated to craft and at times can be a burden to get everything.  Most of the time, private servers will require another program such as Hamachii  Overall BUY THIS GAME. Even if you're a minecraft player who thinks you won't like this, wait till a sale and buy it because it's worth it.  I give this game a 9.0/10  (I'll be putting out more reviews and you'll notice, it's hard to punch an 8 out of me if it isn't something I don't think is worth it.)  This game is awesome and it's pretty cheap for all it has. I highly reccomend this game and will gladly tell anyone to buy this. While this game is pretty amazing, it also has some very small faults and can get annoying, Achievements are coming in tomorrow so it may make some of the con's a bit less confusing.  If the game wanted to be a full 10.0/10 making the crafting a bit less complicated would help a lot, like being able to look at an item and see what it makes and having a built in invite only world option or something like that.

369070,Slain: Back from Hell,"I had this title on my wishlist for quite a while. I just thought that the artwork looked so awesome and it seemed to have a good soundtrack too.

And unlike some people reviewing I've had absolutely no problems with the controls using an Xbox One controller.   What I too would like to see, is a meter that showed how many times I've been SLAIN! If you DON'T like to be killed in a game, then I probably wouldn't recommend this ;)  All in all, 12,99€ (11,69€ on launch) really isn't that much money and I believe I got my money's worth with this game.",1,0
306130,The Elder Scrolls Online,"When your in your mid 20's and you feel like you've played every MMO the internet has the offer, everything kind of feels stale.. at some points you don't even play the damn game, you just download it for 5 hours, skim through the character creation, a quest or two and never log in again. I can guarantee anyone who has played WoW as a kid can remember the feeling of awe and feeling of adventure when you first logged in.. The sense of community, the sense of being in ANOTHER world, immersiveness, etc. Of course overtime as new games come out and new expectations are made - you look back at a game like WoW now and that sense of adventure is almost non existant.  (Not a WoW bash, I used to love the game religiously)  BUT NOW WE HAVE ESO! BOYS N GIRLS LEMME TELL YA, THIS ♥♥♥♥ IS AMAZING!  GAMEPLAY/INTERFACE 8.5/10 The one thing I hated about MMO's, was once you reached max level - you had a ♥♥♥♥ load of macros to set up and a whole lot of spells/abilities to cater for. With ESO, even though it has been simplified in a way that you won't get confused - all passive &amp; active abilities can be tuned to how you want to play. The character customization can let you build a Battlemage Warrior to a Tanked out Rogue. (Think classes from Oblivion, that's what they've done here, and WELL!) All combinations of abilities, class, weapon and armor type can all be tailored to how you play, but still be viable in a dungeon group or a game of PvP. The smoothness transition in combat is one to die for in MMO's these days, you'll just have fun killing mobs like you would in a game of Skyrim, having a very similar hack and slack style mechanic. The game's interface is fluid and well taken care of, also comparable to the menu settings in Skyrim.  The following class types are: Dragonknight, Templar, Nightblade &amp; Sorcerer Weapon types: 1h, 2h, 1h + Shield, Dual Wield, Bow, Destruction Staff &amp; Restoration Staff Followed by all of your favourite playable races!  Now everything from your race, class, weapon type and even crafting proficiency will provide your character with different stats, abilities &amp; way of playing, so have fun! Don't settle down for your first character, give em all a shot and see what fits you!   Walking around with my increased stealth stats lets me wander around city to city, scavenging through boxes and chests undetected (Yes, they have the pick lock systems just like the other games) to get cooking supplies, which I then make into high level foods and drinks which sell for high on the AH. Steal your ingredients, make more money! Or just even be a full time thief and take it back to the Thieves guild fence for a bit of coin..  The sense of immersion I get from this game, it can sometimes feel like a singleplayer rpg. Communicating with NPC's and ACTUALLY listening to the quest storyline is actually.. fun.. which is something that's usually skipped over in most MMO's. The immense amount of lore and nostalgic references from the old games leaves plenty to the imagination, especially if you're the roleplay type.   The auction trading service is amazing - It all starts with guilds out bidding each other on NPC vendors who control spots in various places to sell their guild items to the public. If you and your guild scrap up enough gold, you can outbuy other guild traders and take their spots, enabling your guild to auction of items, lots of fun!    AUDIO 7/10 The only reason I didn't give this a higher score is because some of the music is straight out of Skyrim, but other then that - the actual music they have created for the game and the general audio of the game is beautiful. No complaints   VIDEO 8.5/10 Visually stunning, breath-taking and probably the most graphically immersive MMORPG on the market, in my honest opinion. If you have a decent computer that can run this at high settings, half the time you'll probably just stand around looking at sh*t coz how pretty it is.   COMMUNITY (VARIES, CURRENT SCORE 6.5/7 out of 10) I've played this on PS4, PC and XBOX One.  The community on PS4 bloody brilliant, I participated in an all Orc roleplay guild who would run through cities screaming 'FOR MALACATH!' on their mics. We all wore the same armor and ran through making a name for ourself. Because the only way to communicate on consoles was with a microphone, you could walk into a main city and just start talking with people like if you walked into a cafe in real life.. Not so much with the PC version, but the sense of immersion and community vibe is still there. It's a type of community I miss in MMO Games.   PVP 7/10 PVP is huge ♥♥♥ battlegrounds designed for big army warfare. Imagine playing a game of Age of Empires but instead of controlling the whole army, you just control your one dude. You could have 20 players attacking the south side of map taking over a castle, while another 20 or on the north side taking over a farm - and they're a good 30min walking distance from each other. THINK HUGE There is also dueling implented as of recently, really nicely balanced!  PVE 8/10 No complaints, it feels like a singpleplayer game half the time and just feels awesome when you run into a bunch of players doing the same quest as you. Great dungeons, great loot, a good rewarding feeling after every quest. Everything has been scaled recently, so now that old places you have outleveled months ago will be a challenge again, leaving low level places still worth adventuring for treasure.  CRAFTING 9/10 Oh man, crafting is my favoutite in this game, it feels rewarding as hell. Most of the best items created in the game is through crafting, there are unique designs from Daedric, Dwarven, Orcish, Argonian armor designs etc. It's straight forward and easy to grasp for even the most beginner player. No complaints  CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION 8/10 You're going to spend a lot of time before even logging in, just working on your dudes nose.. trust me. You can customize your armor color (Colors unlock depending on ingame achievements) Classes aren't bound to armor types, so go ahead and be a heavy armor rockin' mage if you like!   THERE'S PROBABLY SO MUCH I'M MISSING BUT YEAH, GET THE GAME! ITS FUN!  ",1,1

Its a very chilled out game, but in now way makes you take a backseat as a player. The combat is more annoying than enjoyable, but luckely can be completely avoided.

620,Portal 2,"This has got to be one of the most fun, most rewarding and entertaining experiences I have had in a game. First I simply played the single-player and enjoyed it a lot, felt I received my moneys worth. But after playing a bit of coop with my sister I just felt inspired to get around and write a review. So where to begin? Perhaps gameplay. It takes a gimmick, shooting portals to travel, manipulate stuff and ultimately solve puzzles. Portal 2 runs with the gimmick and, in true Valve-style, creates puzzles which feel more rewarding and organic than typical videogame puzzles, where it usually feels like you are trying to mind-read a cryptic all-powerful creature, a creature which tries its best to mask what it wants from you, which punishes every experimentation and failure harshly and without even giving you a clue of where you went wrong. Instead, Portal does things like Half-Life 2 did (I touched upon it in my  HL2 review here ), there´s more of a sense of observing, putting things together without too much arbitrary design choices and rules which never seem to stay consistent and trustworthy. Portal 1 and 2 has some arbitrary things like portals firing upon white surfaces, but it makes this clear and stick with this rule, it creates an environment where learning the rules is not useless, but you keep adding them up lawfully, like a scientist exploring how the game universe operates. It´s fun to figure puzzles out, rewarding, and you can incrementally add up the steps, instead of having to hold in mind a complicated maze and then have to succeed on your first try or start from scratch. I mean, you can and have to strategize, but it can be done in parts, and it is more organic, than feeling gamey, like having to remember the way to put some tilepuzzles together from some scrap of a picture you caught a glimpse of earlier in the game. The Single-Player story was fun, the pacing, telling, the little details you can pay attention to or run past are immersive. I could go on, but many of the strengths of Valve games are here in Portal 2, so what I´ve said about HL2 applies, in the style of relying on atmosphere, environments and observation, coupled with narration. It was a well rounded satisfying experience. I´ll admit it´s now some months since I played SP so I can´t go to more details, but my impression is still very positive. I still have a general idea of the actual substance of the story, it was a bit whacky at times, a scifi story with comedic twists and turns, but it was still told well and had the content was enjoyable, even Wheatley for me, though I´ve heard some were annoyed by that character. But the coop has been utterly fabulous. From the simple way to invite friends and jump into the game, the joy of figuring things out and the game giving the tools to allow you to communicate effectively (mic obviously a tool available), with pings with options to point out where to stand, what to look at, how to interact with, the remote view which allows you to see things from your friends perspective, and just the dynamic, organic humour of flying around portals, messing around, gesturing in a silly way, taunting Glados-- I haven´t played it yet fully, but I expect many more similarly enjoyable rich hours. There´s some story in there as well, it feels like Valve wanted the coop to be rich enough to stand equally strong on the SP campaign side. Some even like the coop more than SP, and I´m starting to see why. As a source engine, the game looks beautiful, plays solidly with little problems, bugs or performance issues, and is a great open engine allowing tweaks and mods. The game has Workshop and will possibly add even more fun to play, both SP and coop. If I were someone to give scores, my initial playthrough would have been a solid lovely 8-9/10, but now after starting to fool around with coop, this is simply 10+ out of ten for me.",1,0

232430,Gone Home,"Gone Home thrusts you into the body of Katie Greenbriar, an annoyingly generic college-goer who has returned to her family's vacant abode for a visit. As Katie, you can spend much of your time barricading the downstairs toilet with every movable item on the first floor and proceed to also fill up the various empty pizza boxes with non-consumable items, including a lone condom and at least a billion copies of her father's moronic novel.  Aside from offering the ability to stack and unstack household objects for literally hours, the game does provide a realistic, moderately gripping love story revealed by, obviously, displacing more objects.   The voice acting is believable and definitely an integral strength, and the inclusion of playable feminist punk tapes throughout the home gives the game some needed spice. Additionally, both Sam and Lonnie are likable characters with a tendency to be cute and clever in their notes to each other.   Despite the enjoyment I derived from playing this, I wouldn't recommend paying full price. I think if I had not purchased it for $2.99 during a flash sale, at the end of the game I would've been too distracted by my discontentment over squandering $20 to appreciate the notable qualities.",1,0

283880,Heroine's Quest: The Herald of Ragnarok,"Wow! There is not a better value on Steam. If you grew up on the old Sierra adventure games like Quest for Glory, King's Quest, Police Quest, Conquests of the Longbow, or Space Quest, then you can easily spend 30+ hours playing this game. I've not even completed the game once, yet, and I'm having a blast. This is truly a spiritual successor to the Quest for Glory series, unlike Quest for Glory V. Think of this game as the Quest for Glory V that should have been. I'll give an explanation as to what I mean.  If you played QFG3 and QFG4 (or the VGA remakes of QFG1 and QFG2), then you're familiar with the QFG format. It's a point and click adventure game with an RPG style of character development. You get a character sheet in the beginning and spend some 'free points' in different skills and attributes. Then, you're dropped in the world to quest. As you use skills, they level up. All of the QFG games followed this format, but QFG5 changed the interface in a major way. It was the first '3D' QFG game. The character could be controlled with a turret-style control scheme, and combat wasn't compartmentalized the way it had been before. So, the game felt very clumsy overall and didn't have the same feeling as the previous four titles. This game brings everything about the QFG style of game right back where it belongs.  The game starts by having you select one of three classes, just like QFG. The classes are essentially the same as the Fighter, Magic User, and Thief from QFG. There isn't a Paladin class in this series, but there is an honor mechanic which could possibly imply a Paladin class in a sequel (PRETTY PLEASE LET THERE BE A SEQUEL!!!). You then are able to distribute 50 points across your character sheet. Your character will solve in-game problems in different ways based on your skills. A Warrior might ram a door down. A Rogue may pick the lock. A Wizard may blast it or cast an Open spell. And, these might not be the only options depending on the exact situation. Maybe you just knock and trick the guy on the other side to open it so you can club him on the head. There are skills for all of these actions, so you need to pay attention to your skill set when you make your character.  Once the game starts, you find yourself in a harsh, winter environment. You're broke. You have 15 coins, and a decent meal at another nearby town costs 8 coins. You can't stay outside too long without freezing to death, and the weather is constantly sapping your stamina. Along the way, you'll find ways to secure food and battle the cold, but life is hard at first. You also don't have your equipment. You have your weapon and some basic items, but you will be missing your gear pack due to the opening events of the game. You'll meet the townsfolk, find ways to feed yourself, pick up quests, and get some leads on where to find your gear. From there, it's up to you, really. You could choose to immediately start doing quests to get some income and items. You could opt to hunt monsters and train up your skills for a few days. You could try and explore the map first. The game world is yours.  Part of the beauty of the this game, just like the QFG games, is the humor embedded in every environment. Something as simple as looking at a tree reveals a pun or some quirky quip. Character dialogues are laced with references to your favorite Sierra games, phrases like 'So, you want to be a Hero?' Too many jokes to count exist in this game, and part of the replay value is finding them all. I'm not even to the second map, yet, and I'm still uncovering things to chuckle at just around the two towns. Occasionally, I smack my forehead, like when I found the gravestone that said, 'Here lies Cedric Diggery. Entered a graveyard alive. Left dead.'   This is truly a gem. You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't have it in your library. Download it and play it. If you're new to the genre, be patient with it for an hour or so. Not many games follow the same sort of RPG development as these games did, and most aren't as unforgiving. When games like this one tell you you're tired, you'd better find someplace safe to sleep! Fail to do so and you'll collapse and die where you're standing and be devoured by the creatures of the night. Climb a tree without a sufficient enough climb skill and you may just fall out and break your neck. Take some time to figure it out, and you'll be in for one the most treasured types of gaming experiences in gaming history. There's a green button up there. Press it.",1,0

202970,Call of Duty: Black Ops II,"To start off my review i will start with the Extremely Immersive Campaign, The campaign for this game has been the best in the past 4 years. Very fun and challenging at best, and a very hookable campaign. Multiplayer is fun but on PC its very scarce to find a Hardcore match. Zombies is always the best, considering the fact that most of everyone who plays Call of Duty, has played more Zombies than Multiplayer in their COD Career. Personally I have spent more time on Campaign, Zombies and Multiplayer, in that order. I give this game a 10/10 Would Play Again. &lt;3",1,0

I think one thing they did really well was they took actual events and places that happened and then spun them to where it wasnt just replaying history so that was definitley a plus to me.

239350,Spelunky,"What starts off as an unforgiving and somewhat brutal platformer, Spelunky blossoms into a richly deep and satisfying game which rewards patience and strategy. It definitely takes quite a number of hours of play before you can get far, but once you do you will be absolutely hooked.  As a rogue-lite platformer, each game is randomised and death is never too far away, as you only start off with 3 health.  Decisions you make in the game are often trading off risk vs reward. Much of the game is optional, as getting to the exit of each level, if done directly, is quite easy. The trick is when to know to venture from the beaten path, and how to take on various enemies to score loots.  Recommended that after a few hours of play to check out the wiki, but even at almost 20 hours I find I'm still discovering subtle mechanics and new strategies.",1,0

Gives rise to some SERIOUS existential thinking, it's absolutely beautiful to look at and challenging to even long term fans of the puzzle genre. The story is lightweight in the way it's presented to you (it's not forced down your throat, and you could pretty much ignore it if you really wanted to) but is compelling and has several times during the game very much moved me Absolutely the only downside is that the puzzles have only a few mechanics, but even this is overcome by the way in which the level design is put together - what you thought you knew from that puzzle a few levels ago is pretty much the same in this one, but disguised in such a way that its hard to tell you've only recently done pretty much the same thing.  Demo doesn't have any story hooks, but shows the gameplay well - I bought the game based off this alone and I regret not one single penny!",1,0

So much so that I am still learning tactics 8 hours in (at the time of this review). Its very addictive.  Positives that I haven't seen mentioned much: - You can attack as fast as you can press a fire button/key (10 rocket launcher rockets per second, no problem) and it doesnt break the game mechanics. - Good combination/balance of weapons that initially seem arbitrary but all have their use once you run through a couple dozen times.  Some negatives: - The graphics are going to turn people away. - I wish there was a way to quick select a weapon rather than scrolling through them all  Tip: - for later levels always stealth before entering a new room and keep stealth up while exploring a room.

274270,NOT A HERO,"Not A Hero is an interesting game involving fever pitch combat mixed with nonsensical but on target humor where you do things that are fitting of the title.  Basically, run through identical buildings with different layouts, shoot lots of baddies, be awesome, die a lot. Simple.   Death comes fast (towards you and your foes) but most of the time the levels are short enough that a single death won't put you back too much. The longest of the 25 levels is about 4 or 5 minutes even if you're rushing through, and a lot of these happen towards the end of your heroic murderspree. Which is an aggrivating issue especially when you reach a point where some enemies can one hit kill you.  That said, the game is very well balanced. Each of the nine playable characters are unique and have enough quirks between them to justify playing starter characters even in later levels. Each level of the game highlights what our cast can do well whether it be attack enemies from both sides, move fast, execute silently, or more. Of course the later characters are more powerful, though they end up surrendering the use of powerup equipment in the process (which honestly isn't too big of a loss).   Not A Hero is a lot of fun to play from beginning to end, despite the aggrivation involving deaths. It's got some awesome varied voice acting too which helps with the constant dying thing. It is a twitch sidescolling shooter though so if you don't have the reflexes or the quick wit you best find something else as the game only gets faster. If you think you're up for the slaughter, then pick up this game whenever you feel like it - on sale or full retail. Hopefully there'll be a rad sequel.",1,0
497180,Street Legal Racing: Redline v2.3.1,"One of the best street racing games ever made!  Build up your car, cruise around, race some folks, run from the cops, smash your brand new car, rinse and repeat. I have spent countless hours on this game as a kid and it's STILL one of the best games I've ever played. Don't get me wrong...the physics kinda suck and the game itself is buggy as hell. But it's still an amazing simulation of what street racing is. Being able to build up the entire motor, suspension and body. Tuning specific parts to change how the car behaves. This game taught me what tires couldn't fit on my car, what spring rates and timing was. Mixtures of Gearhead Garage and NFS:U.  Do yourself a favor and pick up this game. I promise that if you are into cars in the slightest (building them), then this game is definitely for you! Now that it's on Steam, and the Workshop is coming, I think Street Legal Racing could make an epic comeback. Join us and help bring back this gem!",1,0
290770,The Fall,"Pretty short but increidibly interesting. Awesome character development with the protagonist and the antagonist is a different but fantastic villain. A bit pricey for how short it is though. The atmosphere provides enough creepy aura to make the game have that horror game feel without actually being a horror game. The puzzles are pretty difficult at some points and have that 'where do I go what do I do' helpless feeling which might be my only negative view of the game. However figuring out the puzzles after that frustration factor sets in is incredibly rewarding and makes you feel good about yourself. All in all I'd give it an 8.5/10, the only thing docking it points being the length of the game and the mediocre conveyance with the puzzles.",1,0

But the cons really aren't enough to make it not worth playing.  ==PROS== - First off, it's FREE! And the things in game you do pay for are all aesthetic. So there is no Pay-to-win here. - LOOT!! Loads of loot that is satisfying to find - It looks fantastic! Lot's of gore too - The passive skill tree is amazing - Heaps of nostalgic feelings. If you loved Diablo 2, then play this! - The new potion system is somewhere between classic potions and health globes. But the ability to find 'magic' potions makes it fantastic - Skill gems are weird, but it's grown on me - The corpses of monsters staying piled up is gruesome and satisfying  ==CONS= - Some of the animations are funky. Running looks odd. And there isn't always a lot of oomph to attacking - Can sometimes be lag, where hit's take a second to register (not often though) - I like the removal of gold, but sometimes the bartering system can be super annoying - I wish there were more acheivements.

It has an extremely steep learning curve and until you get your hands on some weapons and some money it's extremely difficult (even on easy!) but once you get going there's a really well made FPS here with some great RPG elements, good level design and an entertaining story. It's showing its age but is a far cry from the by the books, cover shooter FPS games we see today. Well worth persisting with.",1,1

The goal is mainly just to stop the divers, and S.T.E.V.E has an extremely high health considering I've just been battering him for the past half hour. And then as divers, it seems very difficult to control them; I often end upside down. However, I'll reccomend this game, for two reasons. 1) It's well built, I haven't discovered any bugs and the overall experience matches the genre it's listed under. Because of this, I believe that issues such as the ones listed above may be smoothed over and rectified. The second reason, honestly, I ♥♥♥♥ my pants playing as a diver.",1,0

379720,DOOM,"I would highly recommend this game for the single player but I wouldn't recommend it for the multiplayer.  Multiplayer : The fast paced action dodging projectiles is part of the franchises core. But in multiplayer they have the weapons that instantly do damage and then the weapons that take time to travel before they cause damage. The issue is that a good majority of the players use the shotgun, chain gun or static rifle(sniper). So if you choose to use the pulse rifle you are at an immediate disadvantage because you can not dodge their shots but they can dodge your shots. When you are getting hit the sound that you are being hit is pretty subtle, sometimes I don't even realize that I'm being hit from behind until I'm already dead. This is using headphones as well(Sennheiser HD 598) to be specific. Lastly is the armor pick ups. If you spawn and you come across another player that has been a live for a while and has full armor you are at an immediate disadvantage even though you just spawned.  Single player : This still stays true to the franchises root but also isn't afraid to be it's own game. There is still locked doors with keys that are colored to let you know what door that you unlock with the key. The enemies are either have ranged attacks that travel over time or are melee enemies. Some enemies that have ranged attacks will try and come to melee you as well. There is lots of secrets, you get around 10 weapons with weapon mods to play with and you get to upgrade your health/armor/ammo supplies as you go through the campaign.  The hardest difficulty is by far my favorite to play. When you die you have to restart the entire campaign over and the enemies are very challenging. There is also an easter egg in the game which has the original Dooms sprites and music in it which is a awesome tribute to remembering the original Doom video games.",1,0

The story is short and sweet, but very underwhelming; I saw the ending coming before I even played the game. I will say that everything feels natural, if only it wasn't so predictable.  The visuals are a treat to the eyes, and the soundtrack is beautiful; however, this game is more about the experience of you playing it, but the problem is that there's not much the game offers to experience.

The story while not ground breaking, has an original flair to it managing to mix in some dark humor in it's seemly childlike charm.

32450,LEGO® Indiana Jones™ 2: The Adventure Continues,"Similar to the movie, 'LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues' doesn't compare to the original Lego Indy game, BUT it does seem to hold on it's own quite well.   I would not call this game 'short' in any way, but does feel easier than the original, mostly because of lack of collectibles and an increased number of minigame-type stages. Some say this may be better because it allows for more of a free-roam experience, but it led to confusion at times when searching the overworlds for certain stages. Plus it's required that you know what character are needed for each level, if you one that is equipped with the wrong item, you have to go back to the overworld, grab a character that fulfills the required item (eg. shovel, whip, bazooka) and only then can you advance.  Overall I would give this a 7/10. Again, I can't be too critical as this game is meant for kids, but it does seem significantly easier than previous installments in the LEGO game series. Maybe just completing the story you may find it a little lackluster, but with that being said, I did have quite fun completing it too 100% and suggest anyone pick this up if it ever goes on sale. Usually Lego game are at a consistent $20 which, in my opinion, is pretty steep, BUT if you ever find it at 50%-75%, it really is worth it.",1,0
225080,Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons,"This is a fun game with some great puzzles and story. It can be beaten quickly, and it doesn't have very much replayability, but I strongly reccomend it for people who like to do playthroughs on youtube or like story-driven games. The games story is easy to understand, but I won't spoil it. Due to the fact that the people in the game speak a made up language, you have to really just guess what it is. The conrols are easy to learn, but hard master. Basically how it works is the left side of the controller controls the older brother, and the right side of the controller controls the younger brother. This does make it hard at times when they start to move to seperate sides of the screen, which makes the controls cofusing, and you will probably die. Finally, the graphics and music are both BEAUTIFUL, but you need a really good computer to handle them without too much lag. Brothers: a Tale of Two Sons gets a 9/10",1,0

Sanctuaries are gamebreaking for healing but more importantly for tp-ing on them. Bushes are full of holes, this is so LoL-ish... This map is totally ruined.  I could have adapted to any changes they made... EXCEPT the MAP. I feel every minute: lost, out of position, gankable, with an anxiety about also new creep camps to stack (i play support), new runes, i was ready for TI with the older map, now i feel like a baby that can barely walk...

Whole thing plays like a really good Sci-Fi movie, much better in fact than the tripe they're passing off as Sci-Fi these days (I'm looking at you, Skyline).  Combat is pretty fun, inventory management is...better in the second game, but it's hardly bad in ME1, just not ideal. The last hour and a half of play in the game is far too epic to go into, all I will say is that it moved me :D  For how cheap it is now, you can't really afford NOT to buy it, hours of entertainment for pennies!  8.5/10",1,0

I know how to play chess, I've been playing sense I could walk, which is longer than mostly of you reading this have probably been alive.

Lots of great character races and classes to choose from with no restrictions on combos, Wanna make a halfling barbarian with almost no strength? go right ahead....  Graphics are very very good considering the age of the engine and a extreme amount of detail has gone into the individual player avatars. (dont expect 2015 level AAA graphics)  The story is as twisting and turning as you would expect from thse developers and the moral choices are really good at making you sweat. (Do you want to better learn about your [secret mystery spoiler] by sacrificing some poor villagers to zombies?)  the difficulty is good. Dont expect to wander through the first few areas simply attacking spawns and clearing out each zone as you go...that will quickly lead to a party wipe.. You need to assess if each situation is worth fighting or if you should simply sneak past and come back with help?  All in all an excellent game that makes excellent use of an older game engine.

7940,Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare,"I first reviewed this game on 12/11/2011 and I had praised it as fun, low cost, and surprisingly active for a much older game. I didn't think much of it at the time other than a generally good game. Boy, I had no idea.  It is now 2016 and the game is almost a decade old. Since then, my opinon of COD4 has actually gone up. Not only is it the oldest game that I still play regularly beating out even newer games I've purchased, but it is still 'surprisingly active'.  Every single multiplayer mode still has at least one or two active servers. More popular modes like FFA and TDM, of course, has tons of active server. I'm still playing FFA/TDM with upwards of 20+ players at all times of the day. A decade old game!  Even better, multiplayer has some mods that people use and my favorite has come to be 'Reign of the Undead' (ROTU) -- a zombie mod which is unbelievably fun and also very active with many servers containing 5+ players regularly (and some as high as 10+). Sounds small compare to the main MP modes, but you really don't want more for ROTU.  Overall, COD4 has turned out to be an incredible value. I wouldn't have regretted this purchase had I paid full $60 price, but instead, I only got it for $20. Frankly, I got a steal for a game that I've been playing for so long and still intend to keep playing.",1,0

It's a reflex game where you navigate your cursor around plain, spinning rectangles, with barely anything you can call graphics, and little to no gameplay.

Other than the standard 'complete the level' achievements (which mean getting to the 5th score multiplier on every difficulty level, after which it just stops and stays forever on the fifth one, which is also one of the reasons it feels like an unfinished product, but I digress) there is nothing more that either tedious busywork (dying 1000 times, or collecting 100 of the rarely appearing power-ups, speaking of which, other than the invincibility one, they don't even matter) or just impossible (getting 10 million points which, depending on the difficulty level, would force you to stay alive for around 1,5 to 3 hours... but no one is actually sure, since the game doesn't give you any feedback to how many points you actually get, and even the developer is not completely sure as to how the game calculates that.)

381210,Dead by Daylight,"UPDATED REVIEW The game is a 4v1 survival/hunting game. Basically you can be The Killer or The Survivors. There are 5 different killers with 5 different ways to play them. Trapper - traps, Hillbilly - instantly incaps, Wraith - cloaks, ♥♥♥♥ - I mean Nurse - teleports, and Shape - stalks/instatly incaps. The goal is to sacrifice or kill all the survivors before they can escape. As for the Survivors. There 6 different survivors with 6 different characteristics. There is Dwight - supports/boosts, Claudette - supports/healer, Meg - agility/adredaline, Jake - sabotage/calm, Nea -stealth/agility, and Laurie - spotter/baiter. There goal is to activate the remaining generators to open the escape gate. They also have to rely on teamwork. And hide from the killer. In my previous review I said how there was no teamchat. Well they added a chat in lobby and after the game ends. So you can do some preplanning with teammates. Otherwise use Teamspeak or something. I also complained about servers. They have improved them working a lot better. (9/10) ORINGIAL REVIEW The game play is great. Extremely fun and intense at moments. Though there is no team chat which results in a lack of teamwork. Sadly I find myself carrying the game. Another side note to consider is that the servers are absolute crap. Half the time the servers disconnected or steam just goes down. Really kills the fun. I'd give it a 6/10 until some changes are made. Please release an update soon.",1,0

Edit 1:  Though the resolution issue has been corrected, the lag still remains. My laptop is able to run games that are more hardware demanding than this one. The only reason that I can think of, on the surface, of why there is such lag is due to the lack of support with integrated graphics. It's that or a condition is not being met in code that would correct the issue and not cause other issues on the other platforms. Again, this is surface/speculative thoughts. The Telltale team is full of tallented men and women. They know their product and are no doubt correcting the issue further. So lets hang in there.  Edit 2:  Not sure what the second update corrected, but it must have been small given the time it took to download was only a few seconds.

There are no resources, you just build a building and it automatically produces resources for the next tier of buildings. The buildings require maintenance and sometimes the maintenance workers get stuck trying to get to the building to repair it. Luckily they just start repairing from where they are, but only after a significant amount of time has passed. The building area is in a crater, which is neat, but the actual building area is square which looks terrible once you start getting more buildings out.",-1,0

250620,Among the Sleep,"First, the bad: its short. Even with the free DLC extra chapter, its short... like under 4 hours short. There is not a ton of replay value unless you get drawn into the story and want to go back to see little meta-clues and child-drawings you missed. The couple of graphical glitches, overlapping lighting through doors, odd seeing through objects at odd angles... not bad honestly, and definitely not game-breaking.  The good: this is a rather well told dark story, and seeing it explored through the body of a 2-yr old child is a very unique approach to telling it. Your adult-brain logic being used to guide the character through the puzzles and tale aside, they've done quite a good job of making you feel like you're interacting through a toddler. As a small child you are clumsy, slow, very poorly armed and armored against the shadows that crawl along the walls and roar out through the dark... your only defense is to hide and find comfort in the warmth in your teddybear guide and traveling companion.  There are a few jumpscares, but absolutely no gore... this game uses nothing but unease, shadows and noises, the surreality of childhood nightmares and exagerations, and the inherent helplessness of your character as the basis for it's horror. A significant part of the entire storyline involves some well written emotional manipulation; if you play these kinds of games in any sort of emersive mind-set (or you're just kinda over-emotional like I can be), you will get a far greater experience from this game. You'll be motivated to help the child through this journey, feel afraid of the creepiness of this world, and seeing the tale through the end will feel rather moving in bad and good ways... potentially triggery ways, depending on your own childhood...  If you don't do emersive gaming, if you dont allow yourself to play these kinds of games as if you were nervous about the surroundings, if you just plow through these kinds of hide-from-the-monster horror games... this will be a short game with not much meat on it, and you will likely feel more dissapointed than profound.  Recommended to purchase on sale. Despite the effort and atmosphere that obviously went into the game, the full price of $20 is just a little bit steep for the length.",1,0

You don't even really play as the baddie, despite the fact that you are an undead, you are still defending your kingdom against invaders.  The combat is interesting and strategic with mayn different ways to customize your troops to match your playstyle.  The story is cute but rather shallow.  One thing I really didn't like is that the game punishes you massively for making some decisions. Also the final can be extremely and over the top hard.

I've sunk around 75 hours in it already, and I haven't come close to doing a third of what's available! There's almost 200 missions available when you include GTAV and GTA online.  If you don't have this right now, GET IT! It is well worth the whole $59.99. You've no excuse for NOT owning this game if it ever gets on the summer sales. It's a no-brainer then!  ...and if you are worried about longevity, Rockstar is constantly putting out updates, banning cheaters, and adding content to the game. This will last you a good few years of enjoyment!  In addition, the game is INSANELY optimized. I run it with a GTX660 and I'm able to get 60fps while still being able to crank all the settings to high (with a few exceptions) at crisp 1080p without any crashes whatsoever! I stutter every once and a while and on occassion freeze (not completely, alt-tabbing is enough to fix it), but c'mon, I know a guy who gets 60fps@1080p playing this game using  intel integrated graphics!

And also, give us the ammount of cards that you would get in a pack in real life. Overall, the obvious push for microtransactions makes this game yet another pay to win game.

I quite enjoy the simplicity of it, granting the player a great deal of freedom while always having their own goals and targets. In many ways this game returns to the heart of what made simulation games good, back when simulation was the top of the industry. To think that this quality of process was given by a couple of previously unheard of programmers really puts the flaws of modern industry into perspective.

One time I said in Social Chat, 'prostitution should be legal' and then seconds later I'm banned. I did nothing wrong and if other players can curse and talk about gays, guns, and other opinions then I sure can have mine.  Overpriced items: Most of the things you have to buy with G coins are very overpriced. Some things are ranging into 20-40 dollars for insignificant bonuses, etc.  Community: The community is trash. Simple as that. Due to the overwhelming amount of pure crap in the game most noobs asks questions in the chat. Sometimes everyone continues their conversation as if you never asked anything (politely). And then some people respond very negatively toward you because of how many noobs want answers to their questions.  Then there are people who ignore you for tiny things.

205100,Dishonored,"Dishonored is one of the few games you start playing and dont know what awaits you in the next 5-12 hours. I for myself had a ''wtf''-moment the first half hour I played it. The graphics looked quite comical and reminded me of other games were the textures look painted. But I got after that and was surprised of a gameplay that is uncomparable to games like Assasins Creed or Splinter Cell. The freedom of choice you have while lurking through a London-like City in a steampunk-environment was a big reason for me to play on. And after a few hours I felt really comfortable not only in completing storyline-quests but in exploring every corner of a certain area to get behind every mystery or secret I could find. The dark athmosphere makes it quite hard to just go in for brutal close-combat and so it comes that you always have the choice of sneaking or knocking some enemies out without killing them. When it comes to Skills, Abilities and Weapons I have to say that it is lacking a big variety of such. You just got like 4-5 really usefull spells and a view weapon-improvements that are really necessary, but you could also play the game without any of this just using a knife and a bit of imagination and fantasy. If youre a fan of a mystic and dark Storyline this is a game to aim for but when you buy it with the intention to feel like playing Neverwinter Nights or other RPGs you will be a bit disappointed. 7/10 Points.",1,0

Sure everything is cuddly and cute, but that didn't save it for me.    A lot of people were very positive towards this game and I feel let down. Wondering if that was more about it being Double Fine rather than a reflection of the actual game.

435300,We Know the Devil,"We Know The Devil is a story about three bad kids who are only bad because the world tells them that they are. It's a story about identity and friendship and queerness and love, and feeling alone and left out. It's about wanting to be good, but not being able to because the world is cruel.  Aevee Bee's writing and Mia Schwartz's drawings and Alec Lambert's music channel a mix of anxiety and innocence that those who were bad kids or who still are will recognize. The story echoes teenage feelings of isolation and longing, and fraught love and friendship, and not knowing who you are and being sort of scared to find out. It's only about an hour long, but in that short time, the characters Venus, Jupiter, and Neptune are all beautifully realized, and I played through it several times (during its initial release on DateNighto) to make different choices and learn more about each of them.  The world is cruel, and tells us that we're bad, but we can fight against the actual, literal Devil and maybe we can stop believing them.",1,0

I dont have many bad things to say about it besides a few these few things. The combat is pretty easy. All you have to do is wait to counter. The boarding process gets pretty old pretty quick. Same thing over and over. The last thing being its not Assassin's Creed really. Edward doesn't have to many missions with the Assassins until the last 5ish hours of the game (not including the contracts). The sea shantys are great, its fun to use the Jackdaw the story was slow at first but then kicked in a little while in like most AC games. Sad game but sort of happy in a way.

359390,Amnesia™: Memories,"Overall I really enjoyed this game, but like a lot of otome games it has some problematic aspects along with the good ones.  First, the art is really beautiful even if the characters' outfits are completely, hilariously absurd. All of the sprites and CGs are really pretty, and the backgrounds are sort of a muted colors with white.  Unlike some otome games where you spend the first part of the game getting to know the characters and then figuring out which ones you want to romance, this game makes you choose immediately and then you are locked into that guy's route and can only succeed or fail (spectacularly) at it.  The good part about this is that the stories for each guy are very different, and as your character starts with amnesia (like the title) the mysterious and unknown parts of your life are different between routes. The relationships you have to the love interests and other characters change, which is really interesting and gives the game a lot of replayability since each route is basically its own thing.  The stories are all very engaging, but there are some definite yandere aspects to some of the relationships, so if that isn't your cup of tea you may want to look into which guys have that before playing so that you can avoid those routes. Or choose them, I guess, if you want to be locked in a cage by a possessive crazy person. :)  The bad ends definitely kill you, and since the MC has amnesia, she does tend to fall into the otome heroine trope of being fairly passive. There's a story reason for it, obviously, but if you're looking for a spunky MC with her own personality you won't find that here. MC has a few moments, but she's clearly intended to be pretty bland so that you can read whatever you want into her.  I recommend this game, it's a beautiful game with an engaging story, but it's definitely a Japanese otome game in a lot of ways which can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it.",1,0

I don't think this game is really worth the $4.99 price it's listed on here for the following reasons: 1) Game is over 4 years old  2) is just the base game (I don't think it's been updated with any of the content that the CURRENT iOS or Android vesions have) so we are paying 5 times more for a port of the older version of a game that is on on Google Play and the Apple App Store.

241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"So, overall game is very good. But let us start with each aspect of the game separately.  Story  Actually for Lord of the Rings saga the story for this game is good. I will say very good. Okay if you have been paying attention you'll know that the main character Tallion had his family killed by orcs and he goes on a revenge killing spree. Pretty generic right? Well I disagree. Why? Because Tolkien was one of the first authors who used this kind of 'revenge for your loved ones' thing in his books, if you have read them of course, but gamers don't have time for books ;). That is why I think this story suits the game perfectly. Yes it is a generic story, but it is good. Story is interesting, okay sometimes it falls short, but it's no big deal soon after it picks up. I personally really liked the story, because it was about a time period which is a little bit mysterious. Story happens before Lord of the Rings trilogy, but after Hobitt and it answers questions, how Sauron came to be, who created the rings of power and so on If you haven't read the books then it is quite interesting. Voice acting is very good. Main characters, only few in number, are good, not great and deep, but good and interesting.  Story 7/10  Gameplay  Two words - Nemesis System. This thing is AWESOME. It is very innovative. Okay I will give you an exampe. SPOILER ALERT AHEAD!! An orc, who looks generic, mostly, kills me.    Tallion is a wraith so he can't die.    Afetwards orc is promoted to captain for killing the ranger (me). And I of course go to get my revenge. This time he however escapes to live another day. A time passes. Nemesis system is an AI of orc army so that means my nemesis goes killing some orcs and advances in power to become a veteran captain (appearance of him also changes) and very powerful I might add. Then I get a showdown with him and I kill him by SEVERING his head off :D. The good thing is that the orcs remember you, your past encounters, and they usually say something like this: 'Hey It's you again? This time I'm going stab you so hard, your ancsestors will feel it.' The Nemesis system makes enemies NOT generic, it makes them feel like actual charaters. In 9 h of my gameplay I didn't see other orc captain like the ones I killed. The game feels a little bit like Assassins creed/Batman, in a good way :). Gameplay is very similar to these games. Map is quite big with lots of things to do, lot of sidequests and events, of course collectiables.   Gameplay 9/10   Overall 8/10  Game is very good. Nemesis system I like to think is the future for open world games. In recent games it is one of the most innovative things. If you like Lord of the Rings saga, buy the game, if you like fast paced action and memorable encounters, this game is for you.",1,0

383870,Firewatch,"I wasn't entirely sure what to expect going in, but from the first sarcastic remark, I was hooked. Though not without its share of flaws (run length, somewhat predictable plot, occasionally irksome backtracking), Firewatch draws you in with an intriguing mystery and some beautiful views, but its two main characters are really what sets it apart. They are both perfectly voice acted and brilliantly characterized.   Pros: Believable, thought out characters Excellent voice acting Witty dialogue Absorbing mystery The ending isn't overdone and fits well That sunset though  Cons: Underwhelming conclusion to the mystery Extremely linear Backtracking Short for the price  Firewatch is more like an interactive art piece than a typical game. Though games of this type are becoming more common, Firewatch really knocked it out of the park in my opinion. 8/10",1,0
224760,FEZ,"At first glance, this game seems like your standard charming 2D indie platformer, but you'd be wrong.  You play as Gomez, and your goal is to find a bunch of cubes and cube fragments scattered across various worlds in order to restore the universe to its normal state (and keep it from tearing apart). The twist comes in once you receive the titular Fez: you can rotate the world in a three-dimensional manner, but it stays 2D from your perspective. Platforms can grow, grow apart/closer, or disappear entirely depending on how the world is rotated. Later on, there are quite a few challenging puzzles to decipher (you may need internet guides for more than a few of them), and some additional items to collect besides the golden cubes. My only real complaint is just a standard problem with platformers: it's easy to get lost, and you'll do quite a bit of backtracking for stuff you've missed.  Overall, very highly recommended! Also, this game will run fine on computers that don't seem to meet the system requirements (I have no idea why a 2.8 GHz Core 2 Duo is recommended, this runs great on my 1.9 GHz Core 2 Duo system), so if you have a toaster of a computer, give this a shot anyway.",1,0
16810,Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Colonization,"Disregard Civilization, aquire Colonization.  Seriously, it's a standalone expansion pack, so unless you have an extra 10 bucks and want to give vanila Civ4 a shot I'd just go strait to this one.  ---  If you're familiar with Total War you will NOT be familiar with this. Rather than focusing on your army and it's compossition, placement and what not, Colonization puts in the role of governer, not general. Micromanaging a number of towns and exploiting the new world's natural resources and dealing with those bloody natives, either peacefully or by blowing their brains out with your supior technology. The overarching goal is to declare independance from Europe, but if you fail to complete the goal in time you still get a score victory for your efforts.  As for combat, you have an overly simplified % chance of victory. Though you can't actually take an entire town in a single turn like you can in Total War. Conflict lasts over several years. But unlike vanila Civ4 (And here comes one of the biggest preferences to Col over Civ) unit production is quite involved, so you wont end up having a single conflict over a single city last over a few decades or even centuries.  So in a nutshell: War game meets Colony Simulator :p",1,0
65080,Kaptain Brawe,"This is one that I recommend only with some rather strong reservations, and on the condition that you get it on sale with a massive discount. For one, this is a game that I replayed twice in an effort to add to my in-game achievements total. I still can't really say why, escept that it was relaxing. But, in any case, that should tell you just how short it is. When you add in the fact that it also is a bit glitchy, causing a need to sometimes go into the auto-saves and load the most recent one, thus doing some amount of replaying, in order to successfully continue the game, the issue becomes even more glaring. The in-game hint system is flawed as well, so if you do get stuck, you can't really rely on it. Fortunately, most of the puzzles are quite simple to figure out, and there are only a couple parts that might truly trip a general gamer up a bit. I managed to get almost all of the in-game achievements with little trouble before getting too bored to keep on with it, but even the developers apparently no longer remember how the trickier ones are earned, or just aren't telling, so if you're playing for that reason at all, be warned that you're mostly on your own there. All of this said, despite the glitches, simplicity, and other issues, the game is actually pretty fun if you enjoy point-and-click gameplay. I really liked the light humor, the 'alternate' ending, and the look and sound of the game as a whole. Yes, it does get boring fast after the first playthrough, and the glitches are irritating when they do trip you up, but if you get it in a bundle like I did, or from a really good sale, then it's definitely worth trying out. If they ever add on trading cards or Steam achievements, I'll say that even more enthusiastically, though most of the time I don't really view those things as important.

I refuse to uninstall my pen tablet. I intend to keep this game because I know it will eventually be good (and I have nothing else to spend the money on), but it will take time to fix.  But seriously, let's be honest here: This game is still in BETA/Early access.  I will do a completely new review once I am actually able to play the game for more than 15 minutes at a time.   Update:  I managed to solve the 15 minute crash problem by disabling the tablet and touch services via the task manager. I can now play the game more than 15 minutes, but I still intend to wait for a proper fix.   Update 2 Sept 22, 2016:  Well they went ahead and screwed it up AGAIN.

The story really pulls the strings of your heart, and it also tugs a bit on your mind. The plot is certainly interesting and the concepts open new trains of thought which only add to the game. The replayability is subjective to how much you like the game. I strongly suggest playing through on hard first. It makes the game feel more accomplished in many ways. The second, could be on easy.

For those unfamiliar with this game as well as the previous installments, the series is very Sim City-esque but with a refreshing take on the city building genre, giving you free rein on your citizens to do what you please. Want to be a absolute dictator, policing your city completely, riging elections and stopping the immigration of people all together? You can. Overall, I highly recommend this game, as well as the previous Tropico games.

There are inspection scenes (like in most detective games) and you have to link the clues yourself.

As a fan of action-mixed RPG games, I found the gameplay quite enjoyable, especially when you have collected a few upgrades for your weapons. The constant GPS cache and artifact collecting can get dull pretty fast, but thankfully, they're not essential to the main plot and game progression. The storyline itself was decent enough for a modern game (even though it is really linear) and definitely better than what the original games had. Lara and the rest of the ensamble have distinct personalities this time, and that makes the story more captivating and lets the player get invested in the plot as a whole. The graphics are really good for the year the game was released in and Lara's hair physics is quite a joy to watch.  This is a great game for one or two playthroughs and even offers a fun multiplayer. I would definitely recommend the game, especially since it's constantly sold at a discounted price.",1,0

292630,Uriel's Chasm,"here is this games story: your a girl who is in a space ship, who is against a giant mouth with wings that is called the garden of peace, and you need to sit still in space to collect faith, untill you have more than the garden of peace. you can destroy the astroids to collect more fuel (REALLY rare), ammo and bibles. what does the bible do? it changes the text at the bottom of your screen. what else does this do? nothing. after that, you are trown in a 2d space shooter where you are flying with a oil tank, where you need to dodge crosses that shoot round disco balls, blue men that are riding blue d***s, and so on. when you reach the end, you fight a xenomorph with the face of an old man, that summons a ball that has a cloak field around it self, and shoots a whole lot of fire balls and small disco balls. then you go on an acid trip to find jesus trees, seven times. when you have completed it, you will be sent into the garden of peace (i think) where you will fight the mega giraffe that shoot 1000 black and white balls at the same time, and you need to shoot it with a infinite amount of books. what happens after? go on youtube, i really dont know. 10/10 would use this to torture myself and my friends again. P.S. did i mention that this game is about religion?",1,1
218620,PAYDAY 2,"I had to edit my review and turn it to negative because I'm kind of disappointed about what this game has become. There are plenty of negative reviews, nearly all of them tell the same thing and mine will be no different. I will just briefly tell you what has gone wrong with this game.   Payday 2 was brillant when it's just released. Yes, there were some technical issues, that's okay but gameplay was awesome. They wanted to took all the best from Payday: The Heist and multiply it. More heists, more masks, more stealth, wide variety of upgrades for the wide variety of guns - all this stuff was supposed to make the game bigger and better. And it actually did. All aforementioned is the pros that made me get back into Payday 2 over and over again.   Now it's two years after the release. I thought the developers would fix bugs but it's become clear long ago that developers decided to go the other way, the way of beating the money out of players by making tons of dlc's. Some of them are useless such as character packs and new masks. Some of them add new weapon which is overpowered in comparison to the default guns so you have to buy this weapon unless you want your criminal career to be over in no time (especially on Death Wish difficulty). Dlc's with new heists also make some sense but now most of players get stuck in two or three heists that give you most XP to gain levels quickly so I don't know. What I do know for sure is that the amount of money you have to waste on this game, if you want to play with others on equal terms, will surely make your wallet cry: 27 dlc's with the cost of approximately 5 USD each. Do the maths.   Another disappointing thing is bugs and technical issues that were not fixed since the release (!). It really lets me down especially considering that there were a lot of promises from devs (such as safehouse upgrade and solving issues with connection) that were also never redeemed. What a shame.   Payday: The Heist's main feature is team work. Payday 2 had this feature until shotgun pack, sniper pack and pack with minigun and RPG came out. Now there is no need in team work - just rush through the heist with the overpowered sniper rifle and you will probably be able not to go into bleedout even once. Stealth is still pretty fun but it's limited with some illogical things such as not being able to take more than a couple of body bags to wrap up corpses of guards.    To summarize I want to repeat that it was a fun game. It IS a fun game now but if you have money to buy dlc's. It's so sad that such a great game has turned to something so shameful and obnoxious. I could recommend this game a year ago or so but now I simply can't do this. Hope everything changes but for now I recommend you to go and play Payday: The Heist with a couple of friends, really.     Payday 2 right after the release: 9/10  Payday 2 now: 4/10   Thanks for reading this review.",-1,1

243950,Divinity: Dragon Commander,"Where to start... First, lets talk about the concept and setting of this game. Being set in a fantasy realm, where technolgy and magic are blended together into a neat Steampunk-like setting. I must admit, it's very appealing.  The gameplay itself, when fighting the enemies, and waging war, seems to split itself between turn based combat, and RTS. Admittedly it's a bit dull, and also rather repetitive, shifting between outright easy and relaxing, to stressfully hard, with no warning between the two. Some might find that appealing, but I honestly don't. HOWEVER, if things go badly for you, you can also jump into the battle yourself, as you are a giant fire-breathing dragon who also is wearing a jetpack. Yes. You are a dragon. With wings, with a jetpack. Very appealing.  Outside of the combat, you take on the role of deciding how the empire should be run in terms of law, certain economical factors, racism, ect. To be honest, I think this was my favorite part of the game, as your morals in the real world don't necessarily work the same in a fantasy world. Here's a good example. In the real world, I believe religious stories should not be part of teaching, my reasons being my own. However, in this game, it made sense to have such stories taught, due to the fantastical nature of the world in which the characters lived. Remember, dragon with jetpack. You would need that kind of teaching.  And as an added little bonus, for once in a game, the undead are not considered evil, or even dark and potentially bad. They are simply just people. A little overtly pious, but people none the less. This is the first game to do that for me, which may be small, but it's a bug plus.  All in all, it's a fun game. Maybe nothing that'll last the test of time, but still a game worth playing.",1,0

250620,Among the Sleep,"Wow what a great and trippy ride! Among the Sleep was far better then what I expected it to be and much more deep also. It dwelves into the childs mind and establishes a form of nostalgic fear. It will find its way into being one of the creepiest games you will play as well as intense. The vice acting was great along with your companion Teddy just making it all work and fit and by the end of it I had very little to complain about. However there are some things worth noting about the game that needs to be brought to light for the optional buyers out there. First, the campaign is not long at all. Two hours tops. So this leads to the second thing, the price for a two hour game is a bit high. 20 dollars US regularly. If you're interested and see this game on a steam sale i reccomend getting it quick and instantly. Now also the last real thing I can complain about is that the game isn't very challengin either. Its scary and has its moments of wonder and intense hiding but really it was very quick and easy to figure out. So in comparison to Outlast (If you have played that game) this is a walk in the park. However I still find it being very enjoyable and worth the two hours and it will even be more fun to watch your friends play in the dark for the first time. Enjoy!  8/10",1,0

24980,Mass Effect 2 (2010),"This was my favorite game of the series. Would strongly recommend, with or without the other 2 games.  Pros +Great crew members (Mordin and Thane in particular) +Your decisions have meaningful impacts within this game +Graphics still hold up well +Normandy has much more life +No more elevator rides that give you enough time to take a nap +Resource minigame is more engaging than in Mass Effect (where you drove around in a buggy across very generic bumpy worlds looking for light, heavy and rare metals for credits)  Cons -Storyline seems arbitrary at a fair amount of points -Personally, I dislike the new ammo system -I told Kelly to feed my fish but I still found them dead :(  Short digression - A lot of people criticize Shepard working with Cerberus in this game (valid) since they're a notorious organization with terrorist inclinations and a disregard for ethics. However, the relation between the Systems Alliance and Cerberus is not analogous to the US and al-Qaeda, but more like Afghanistan and al-Qaeda. Cerberus is still fighting for humanity albeit in a twisted fashion. If anything, the Asari and other council nations represent the US and the west while the Alliance is a rising power like China. Cerberus is a terrorist group that wants human power but with an absolute disregard for anything that doesn't support their specific agenda (since they believe they are the best, fastest, and possibly only hope for humanity).",1,0

This game, in 4 hours, made me laugh so hard, afraid and scared and at the same time I was looking to myself crying like a had never cryied before. Those feelings combined with the best game story I´ve ever seen, made me realise that a game does´t need graphics or gameplay to be a good one... This game is the real example that video games are art... This is why I play games for, the story line combined with a perfect and brilliant soundtrack gives you a great experience, an adventure that touches you so much that since the game starting till the ending I assure that you will be watching one of the best experiences of your life that a media such as this one can give...

255070,Abyss Odyssey,"It looks amazing, it sounds amazing, and (once you get the hang of it) it plays like a dream. Seriously, I was a bit upset after playing it for the first time after buying it, but once I learned how to pull off certain combos, it grew on me like a bad case of hemmorrhoids. In a good way, of course. As of this writing, I only have an hour of play time in and there's a reason for that. My only beef with the game is that it's so unforgiving. An hour's worth of gameplay, and I have made so little progress, people have started nominating me for a position in the federal government. In order to respawn anywhere other than the starting area, you need a camp token. Where do you find them? Hell if I know. Some merchants (very few and far between) will sell one and only one, but they're ridiculously high, and you lose them permanently if you die. On rare occasions, you may stumble across one, but don't hold your breath. If you die (and you will die) you get one chance to respawn by means of fighting as a soldier until you reach an activated check point. My problem is that I've only found three tokens, of which I lost two, and my only activated checkpoint is a hell of a way away from anywhere I need or want to be.

338930,,"I'll be the voice of dissent here but this game has really dissapointed me.  Being a huge Platinum Games fan from the Clover era i went into this with great expectations, mostly from the combat and level design ... and i found out they are both horrible. For whatever reason they decided to focus all on the weapons customizations instead on the combat ... You can customize a lot of guns and blades but there are no combos ... the combat gameplay revolves all around dodging and button mashing until you get to the super attack, it's tedious and in my opinion the worst Platinum Games ever made.  One of the many issues in the gameplay is the fact that they bind the same button for transformation, dodging and super attack, this is disastrous since at hardest difficulty every hit you take drains almost half you total hp making dodging even more important and it happens many times that you have a super attack moment where when you press the dodge button it makes you attack and this lets you vulnerable to the next enemy hit that you will have no way to dodge if this happens.  The absence of a targeting is really detrimenting to many fights, you won't be able to attack what you want, making destroying objects to get heal a total nightmare in many scenarios.  I have no idea how the Korra game had so low receptions while this is so acclaimed, the Korra game was short and the level design was bad, but it had a solid, really deep combat system to evolve and master.  I am not a fan of the Transformer series and i picked this up only because it's from Platinum Games, i think most of the people praising this game are really driven by nostalgia.",-1,1

Someone might find it ugly someone might find it cool.  Cons : Well someone can find it hard. Pitty that it has local coop only. I miss something like scoreboard/leaderboard.

Weapons are divided into different classes, and each type is used differently by each of the playable swordsmen. However the game still feels somewhat unpolished, and at times unbalanced, making the game still feel like its still stuck in Early Access mode. Could just be the growing pains of developing an entirely new fighting system, but at the current price, it's too much of a gamble for my wallet.",-1,0

409450,The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians,"As a fan of dungeon-crawlers, I'm always on the lookout for something new. This is an underrepresented genre on Steam, which is actually rather surprising.  Wizardry ,  The Bard's Tale ,  Might &amp; Magic , and numerous other grid-based franchises got their start on computers, so one would assume there'd be more games to 'carry the torch'. It's understandable, considering how niche the genre has become, but I can't get enough of them. Managames' The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians is an extremely adept dungeon-crawler, and does more than enough to quench anyone's thirst.  Considering the genre, you can't go into this game expecting much in the way of plot. You're several miles deep in a labyrinthian prison, and all of the in-mates have broken free. There are also a plethora of fell-beasts inhabitating the halls because...why not? It's on you to put together a party of four to find the prisoners and escape this nightmare. Like other dungeon-crawlers, this game emphasizes exploration and combat above all else. Your survival is dependent on coming to grips with the battle-system, finding better loot, and never taking anything for granted.  One of the interesting aspects of this game is the class-system. Each class is denoted by their role in battle. Basically you'll want a party consisting of a tank, two damage dealers, and a healer. These roles are self-explanatory, and utilizing them to their fullest extent is mandatory in order to progress. I really like this system, because everyone has to pull their own weight. In RPGs, there tends to be times where party-members aren't really doing anything. They're just another bum with a sword, and you invest in their growth until eventually they learn a spell, or get some important piece of equipment that makes them really useful. Not so with this game, everyone has to play their part, or the entire party will be wiped out.   Combat itself is 'real-time with pauses', which suits the class-system just fine. Most abilities operate on cool-down timers, so it's up to you to rotate through them, while paying attention to the current situation. The tank has numerous methods for pulling aggro, but you still have to keep your over-zealous mages in check, because they can get crushed in a few hits. You also have to pay attention to what the enemy is doing. Their next move is always shown on-screen, so you have ample time to prepare. Over time, you might find that certain strategies are effective at dealing with most mobs of monsters, but you always have to take great care in handling Elite foes and bosses. Every boss in this game has a particularly unique aspect that makes for fresh and exciting battles. There are also a handful of instances where moving around can be advantageous, so that's worth keeping in mind as well.  This game's approach to difficulty is very fluid. There will come a time where you'll feel like you're truly stuck. You've exhausted every available tactic, found the best equipment possible, but you just can't seem to beat that next boss. This is the part where you decide on what to do next. The difficulty in this game is thoroughly balanced, so it shouldn't be impossible for a decent party. However, if that hopeless feeling gets the better of you, the difficulty can be customized at any time. So if you think you could beat the boss if he had 10, 5, or even 1% less health, then sure...go for it. You can always re-adjust the difficulty later. Alternatively, if things are getting too easy (or not punishing enough), you can raise the settings.   Playing around with the difficulty sliders is also helpful if you're using different parties. If for example you wanted a party of four damage-dealers, you could adjust the settings until that becomes an actually viable tactic. It's a neat idea, and while I find the relationship between tanks, healers, and damage dealers to be far more exciting, the level of freedom is still welcome. Experimenting with the difficulty and how it affects various party make-ups can be compelling in itself. There is still plenty of challenge for the purists, who would rather focus on improving their tactics than take the easy way out. Best of all, this system completely defeats the purpose of grinding. Not that you would if you could anyway, since there are a limited number of monsters on every level. Still, it has all of the functionality of making the game easier, but without the large time investment. The 20+ hours you invest into a play-through of this game are going to be spent purely adventuring, not running in-between tiles to fight random encounters.  Another particularly nice attribute of this game is that you won't spend a lot of the time saving &amp; reloading. When it comes to dungeon-crawlers, I tend to play very conservatively. If somebody dies, I reload my last save. If I get back-attacked and I know somebody won't survive the encounter, I reload my last save. The stats I gain from my level-up aren't good enough? Yep, that last save is getting reloaded for certain. It gets annoying after awhile. With this game however, it isn't really necessary. For one, everyone receives experience, even if they lose all of their HP during battle. Characters that are knocked out also recovery shortly afterwards, and HP/MP replenishes quickly. This, combined with the lack of load-times when moving between levels, makes the game really appealing to play. While there are brutally powerful attacks, there's nothing that can really be considered an insta-death spell. If your party is wiped out, you can't blame the Gods of RNG.  The dungeons in this game are all very good. While combat is definitely favored, there are some puzzles to figure out, and even a few devious ones that lead to substantial gear-upgrades. Each level has unique qualities that help it stand out, and the designs don't go overboard, so nothing ever feels like a gimmick. This creates a very natural sense of exploration. It's rewarding to poke around, and since every floor takes about an hour or so to complete, you can make substantial progress in a reasonable amount of time. Also, keep in mind that the time spent on each level can extend dramatically, depending on your difficulty settings.   With its great battle-system, unique approach to difficulty, and a sizable amount of content, The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians is an easy recommendation.

275670,Space Run,"If you are a  masochist Galaxy Trucker  like me, you will probably get at least 10-20 hours of fun out of Space Run.  For those who are wondering if this is anything like the board game Galaxy Trucker, I tell you   it is!  With the twist of having both the building and the flying of GT compressed in a single phase.   In ‘Space Run’ you build your ship as you fly, so the impeding urge to build quick is still present and you have little to no time to adapt to the new events of the trip. As you complete your delivery assignments you get money to upgrade your parts (engine, shields, lasers, etc) and if you fail a mission all you have to do is try it again. The events will be the same within each mission, so after 3 to 4 tries you probably ace each level.  You can also re-run the same mission with you newly upgraded gear to try to maximize your score and money. I played around 20 different missions before it got more difficult and I would like to face in this game. I think the game should have some kind of ‘pause to build’ mode for casual players (such as myself).",1,0

As far as the game itself goes, it seems like you have a slight advantage over the monster right off the bat, but if it reaches stage 2 it has the advantage, and stage 3 you just lose. It's actually hard to beat the monster if you aren't in a coordinated team or the person playing the monster is experienced.  It really is just a big game of chase. I would have expected more actual hunting and more of a cat and mouse game.  The upside to free to play is the complete lack of a marketplace store that is typical of the free to play style games. You can unlock everything in the game just by playing and without having to pay any real money, which is awesome.",1,0

The fact they no longer advertise the game as Multiplayer on this very site just proves they're trying to cover it up.  The fact steam has to disclaim there will be no special exemptions to refund this game is self-explanatory.   Its a $%#@ DISGRACE!   I pre-ordered this game on the hope that what we had seen was only a speck of sand in comparison to the amazing scope this game could accomplish.  At first I loved the art style and the adventure that awaited before I got off my first planet thrilled me. It was not long before it became a drag and I was rinsing and repeating the same thing over and over again.  I still had hope and after jumping through multiple black holes crossing who knows how far in distance it was clear to me that whatever lay waiting at the end wasn't worth it.  This isn't like going to the movies and not enjoying the film, this is like buying a fake painting.  You can like this game for whatever reason but you can not come forward and tell me that they didn't lie to us and promise us something else.

That's right, between 8 and 12. HAVE FUN SCROLLING BETWEEN 30 INDISTINGUISHABLE CHARACTERS.   And every single time you transfer anyything, the game double checks that you're ready to transfer. 'Are you sure?' Well, yeah, seeing as there's ABSOLUTELY NO DOWNSIDE IF I ACCIDENTALLY TRADE SOMETHING BETWEEN MY OWN PARTIES.  This game is just so close to being good, but I'd say if you're really interested in strategy games, you might only get about 10-20 hrs out of this before getting really god damn tired of the menus and quitting.

The gameplay is solid, reminiscant of older third person gameplay- gameplay I personally liked, so perhaps I'm just out of touch... Either way, it is fluid, and feels natural. The controls could do with better placement (running and getting into cover) and shooting gets stale after a while (my advice is try to get all the weapon achievements, it helps you try different weapons and keeps it fresher).

It re-defines the concept of stealth games, giving you plentyful choices and patterns to pick from in order to achieve your objectives, I'll make the review simple.   Compared to other hitmans...  Improvements:  *Stealth System  *Disguise System totally remade *Concealment of weapons improved *Paths and missions clearances *Weapons variety *Graphics in general *Multiplayer features (Contracts)  Steps down:  *Money is worthless on Single Player *There's barelly any incentive to make missions right *You cant pick Loadouts per missions  Overall, the game was a bast improvement over prior games, it got a new skin and new way of doing everything, it's still the same hitman mechanics to the core, but with more sense to them. It's a great game in my opinion, specially if you catch it on a sale.   Replayability is also pretty good if you're hunting achievements and contracts online.   9/10",1,0

265630,Fistful of Frags,"John Felix Anthony Cena Jr. (born April 23, 1977) is an American professional wrestler, rapper, actor and reality television show host signed to WWE. Cena has been credited by WWE as the public face of that organization, and has served as its franchise player since 2005. Cena is the host of American Grit on FOX.  Cena started his pro wrestling career in 1999 with Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW), and won the UPW Heavyweight Championship the following year. Cena signed a developmental contract with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later renamed to WWE) in 2001, debuting on the WWE main roster in 2002. From a generic character in 2002, Cena morphed into an arrogant and edgy rapper for the time period of 2002-2003. Cena later transitioned to his current character, which he describes as a 'goody-two shoes Superman'. However, Cena has been labeled as the 'most polarizing pro wrestler ever' as his character has many supporters and many detractors.  So far, Cena has won 24 championships, with 15 reigns as a world champion (12 times as WWE Champion/WWE World Heavyweight Champion and three times as World Heavyweight Champion), five reigns as United States Champion and four reigns as world tag team champion (two World Tag Team and two WWE Tag Team). Furthermore, he is a 2012 Money in the Bank ladder match winner, a two-time Royal Rumble winner (2008, 2013), and a three-time Superstar of the Year Slammy Award winner (2009, 2010, 2012). Cena has the fourth-highest number of combined days as WWE World Heavyweight Champion, behind Bruno Sammartino, Bob Backlund, and Hulk Hogan. He has also headlined WWE's flagship event, WrestleMania, on five different occasions (WrestleManias 22, 23, XXVII, XXVIII, and 29) over the course of his career.  Outside of wrestling, Cena has released the rap album You Can't See Me, which debuted at No. 15 on the US Billboard 200 chart, and starred in the feature films The Marine (2006), 12 Rounds (2009), Legendary (2010), The Reunion (2011), Trainwreck (2015), and Sisters (2015).[19] Cena has also made appearances on television shows including Manhunt, Deal or No Deal, MADtv, Saturday Night Live, Punk'd, Psych, and Parks and Recreation. He was also a contestant on Fast Cars and Superstars: The Gillette Young Guns Celebrity Race, where he made it to the final round before being eliminated, placing third in the overall competition.  Cena is involved in numerous philanthropic causes; most notably with the Make-A-Wish Foundation. He has granted the most wishes in Make-A-Wish history.",1,0

251060,Wargame: Red Dragon,"CAUTION: I strongly recommend this game, but I give it a thumbs down as I am writing here about the flaws which should be known to be able to enjoy it - I hope the devs will notice, too.   'Wargame: Red Dragon' is the best 'Wargame' so far and the only somehow realistic RTS game out there.  Enough is written about the awesome parts, so I will mention here what I dislike about it.  The micromanagement is not well done, other games make it significantly more comfortable to manage your units.  The AI is not very good and so if you are not very good at giving your troops really idiot-proof orders, they will get themselves killed easily.  The great 3D terrain is hard to estimate regarding its angles, so you often have the problem that in mountain or hill areas your troops cannot see or shoot the enemy as they are aiming too high or low.  The more you zoom out, the less precise is the information about where your units are standing. The overview is bad.  There is no playable tutorial to prepare you for all this, so yeah, you will lose a LOT of units and you will lose a LOT of matches against AI or humans until you find out how everything works.  The devs should really work on fixing the problems mentioned above or consider them in their next 'Wargame' - it should be more accessible and more comfortable to play, and you should be able to select an AI strategy for your individual units or groups of units so that they can work more autonomously.   Ah, and the naval combat is still bad. It is overpowered and already during the creation of your deck it just feels wrong. You can build a nation-limited deck, e.g. France, and then still add U.S. anti-ship planes or a Japanese Warship for naval combat? This doesn't fit to the rest. And if you already have naval combat, then please, add submarines, too!   So much about the gameplay. Technically, the game is really beautiful. The graphics are nice and the engine is really well-optimized (runs perfectly smooth on any system), and I didn't notice any bugs.  The only thing that is really missing is a better campaign. The game has in theory so much potential to make you feel connected to your troops as every solider even has his own name - so why is there no dramatic story to be told? Instead you play kind of chess, read some text messages and fight random matches against the not-so-bright but at the same time overpowered AI. Quite a disappointment compared to many other RTS gems out there. A scripted campaign to teach you how the game mechanics work (e.g. the campaigns in Blizzard's strategy games) so that you have at least a little chance to survive in multiplayer would be far better.   It is hard to give this game a kinda objective rating as there are no competitors. It somehow has the same problem as the ArmA series - they are ambitious games trying to show a quite realistic approach to warfare, they have significant flaws, but at the same time they have no competitors.  CONS: Bad AI, bad micromanagement, very bad UI (wrong unit position indications really, really suck!), imbalanced naval combat, disappointing campaign.  PROS: Sweet engine, great multiplayer, huge variety of nations and units, deck making is fun, endless tactical possibilities and matches with your friends or against them are some of the best ever seen in RTS games.  I'd rate this 7/10   + 1 point for long-time motivation thanks to awesome multiplayer, map packs and nation packs + 1 point for not having any serious competitors and therefore strongly enriching the RTS genre  equals 9/10.  Now go out there, buy it, lose dozens of matches, get frustrated as ♥♥♥♥, try hard and be victorious in the end.",-1,1

Let me also mention that the voice actors for this was spectacularly done. The emotion feels sincere and has some good moments for the wrong responses.  The negative is probably the morals it trys to teach to the player. Mainly, if a girl is talking to you, lie out of your ♥♥♥ and just tell them what they want to hear.

262390,Cloudbuilt,"Cloudbuilt is a fast paced 3D platformer revolving around a character called Demi. The game takes place in a futuristic environment filled with rebotic hostiles and floating platforms which the players need to overcome throughout the game.   The game itself has a pretty simple concept where the player needs to get from point A to point B, however the path the player chooses completely depends on them which reduces the thought of a very linear game which it couldve been. Some paths may have many enemies where players need to either destroy or dodge attacks whereas other paths may be filled with traps which require extreme reflexive skills with th contols.  From playing this game I have to conclude that this had been one of, if not the best game I have played this year. I absolutely loved every part of this game ranging from trying to past an extremely difficult level (2hrs was the longest) and feeling the satisfaction of completing it to observing the beautifully designed maps. I also have to add that the graphics is pretty well done with a style similar to borderlands, however i do feel that some parts have been 'over done' where too many layers of filters have been added which bought in little drops in framerates but it was fine.  The gameplay is great where players need to control Demi's movements to complete each level with many features to assist them. These include wall running, wall hanging as well as having a jetpack was various abilities for use. A gun is also provided for players to kill enemies if wanted which opens the door to even more play styles.  To conclude I strongly recommend this game to people who love platformers, free running or extremely challenging games and I must say that this game is very worth the money you pay if you like these games.",1,0
65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"This installment of the Civilization series, while not as content packed as Civilization V is, certainly has the potential for many hours of enjoyment.  New features and revamped systems provide a somewhat different experience from Civilization V, but many of these seem to be gimmicky or simply not fleshed out enough. The tech web for example is supposed to encourage diverse playstyles and vastly different choices. What it actually does is ensure that anyone who doesn't 'rush' one of the 3 finisher techs (those that give access to Victory Wonders) is almost certainly going to lose.  Warfare is simplified, with there being a massively reduced number of units to choose from, and there are no faction specific unique units any longer. There are also no forts or citadels, making defensive playstyles somewhat less lucrative.   Rising Tide is a good expansion, although I don't think its worth the asking price in any scenario. It simply doesn't have enough content to justify a $30 investment. At most, I'd recommend dropping $15 on, and that only if you plan to play it for a significant amount of time.  TL;DR I say Beyond Earth is probably worth the purchase if its on sale, but don't get Rising Tide until it gets a steep discount.",1,0

Sound: 7 - Soudtrack is pretty decent so far, the voice acting is quirky but well done. The sound effects could use a bit more variation but it hasn't yet ruined the expeirence.  Controls: 9 - Responsive, So far I only used the wired Xbox360 controller, not the mouse and keyboard or two player (a person on each)  Fun Factor: 8 - So far the game is fun, has a nice storyline and doesn't take itself all too seriously. The feel matches the graphics and sound so I would recommend playing it.  I will return to review after I finish the game for a full review.   Enjoy",1,0

232430,Gone Home,"After going home I wish I could leave it again.  This game is extremely short (2 hours or less), which normally I would count as a negative, but for this game it is a massive plus. The game is boring. That's the best term I can think of for it. It's just flat out boring. A close runner-up term is 'overrated'. I truley think that the only reason this game won any Game of the Year nominations is becasue *Spoilers from here* it has a homosexual character that is not a blatant sterotype or a negative caricature. I agree that it's an important step to have characters like this in modern storytelling, but raving about it and handing out 10/10 scores is just misleading to a consumer.  The story is an extremely standard one of teenage romance with the only true difference being the homosexuality. It's so paint-by-the-numbers that I had called the plot after the first two or three notes from your sister. Initially I was not too annoyed by this because at the beginning of the game they start with an atmosphere of a horror game and I thought perhaps the gay sister storyline would take backseat to something far more interesting. Unfortunatley as the game went on it became more and more clear that the horror aspect was just used as a way to pull people in enough to listen to what turned out to be a dull and cliched story. I was really, desperatley hoping that at the end the writers had done something different, such as finding out that the sister had commited suicide in the attic after her lover leaves her to join the army or something completley out of left field like her demon-ghost uncle ate her, but no. No, we just get the 'Oh, she changed her mind about joining the army and now we're going to live happily ever after away from our parents who just don't understand our love blah blah blah' boring, cliched ending.  In the end I just felt cheated by this game. There are vague rumblings about a much more interesting story within this game (ghosts, crazy uncles), but they are complete Red Herrings to keep you interested enough to suffer through the teenage angst story. Even now, several months after playing this, I still get angry when I think about my wasted time and money. I am disappointed by the game so much that I wish I could remove it from my game library, even if I didn't get any money back for it (Thankfully I got it during a sale and did not pay the outrageous $20 that the game normally costs).  Seriously, if you want a purely narrative driven game then there are games that do so much better than this (Walking Dead, The Stanley Parable, The Wolf Among Us, Myst, Monkey Island, etc.). Please look anywhere else if you want a game that makes you feel, unless you love the feeling of boredom.",-1,0

It makes you feel you are actually progressing, not just by lets say 10-15 zones. I pushed a little and after I broke the barier it feels like a highway to the next city where you have to stay and work for some time to spend money on another upgrades to continue further.

403190,Planetbase,"The game works beautifully as far as I can tell, runs absolutely fine. However it's incredibly shallow and consists of nothing more than a very repetetive balancing act, battling with the map you've been given to place increasingly large numbers of structures whilst hoping things pan out with your factories and such.  It's far too shallow and requires an inhuman amount of patience to deal with production misery for me to recommend this, but if you really want a game about colonising a planet, then this might do it for you.   EDIT:  Someone called me out on my profile for only having played just over an hour, so I'll explain why I didn't need any more time - Once you've completed the absolute bare essentials of a base which takes around 20 minutes of getting the balance right and building things in a pretty set order, the game becomes a repetetive slog of repeating the process of adding things to your base as you need them (which is sometimes difficult because the connections system is often interfered with by the terrain with no real way to understand why), there is almost no complexity to the game, I'd compare it to Banished with far less content.  In addition, simply checking your resources requires several clicks through menus, a lack of resource display on the main UI and decent hotkeys makes the game a pretty miserable experience unless you're really committed to it.   EDIT 2:  I guess I need to add another edit explaining why my low game time isn't a good enough reason to ignore this review. The game showed no form of complexity or advancement in the first 2 hours, if a game is incapable of getting you on the hook then that's entirely the game's fault. You can unlock the majority of the buildings you'll be using all the time within 15 minutes of starting the game, and you'll be using them so often that I got bored incredibly fast. The game doesn't go anywhere and the only thing you've got to worry about is randomly having your life made even harder by one of the 'disasters' which amount of having to spend more time alt tabbed out waiting for things to be repaired.  The game is as shallow as a puddle, there's simply no reason to play this over one of the many other far more interesting citybuilding games which have far more freedom and a lot more content. Quite why people are attacking me and coming to this game's defense so quickly - smells very fishy to me.",-1,1

I heard mixed comments saying the game was awesome, boring, and completely pointless. My opinion on this? I'm with the people who say L4D2 is a great game. It is insanely fun. Everyone fits in well, the humor is pretty good, and the lovely chocolate helicopters came from here. I consider this  one of the greatest co-op games of all time.   The zombies are also a part of the humor, as I find them funny when they fly like ragdolls with all of your guns, and definitely not scary, (as if I even cared) and the only 'weird' thing you would encounter is the Witch. You'll probably get used to them in a while though. While some missions are repetitive and the community usually auto kicks you, it's a great game. Definitely worth picking up. Regardless of price.

22330,The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion ,"A magnificent addition to the expansive nature in terms of both fun and size of the Elder Scrolls games.

I wholeheartedly reccommend it for those who don't mind a bit of outdated dialogue and graphics, as the game's liberty and the sheer unrefined enjoyment you'll get from it as a sandbox RPG-fan make up for those things tenfold. Add to that it's modibility and the fact that you can mess around in multiple ways, from being an unquestioned hero, to a nimble-fingered thief, to being a master of magic who makes his own spells, or even the type of person who goes about using the 'kill' command in the console to decimate anyone who looks at him funny (I'm the good guy, I swear!)

227940,Heroes & Generals,"This game is a shining example of how free-to-play all too often = pay-to-win. Eternally in 'Early Access', this game is yet another sad reason why Steam's 'Early Access' program is an overall failure.  Big money weapons are completely OP (e.g. M1/M2 Carbine, Thompson, etc). If you don't pay, good luck spending a few weeks with a catheter and hot pockets and without seeing the sun to earn them without spending cash.  Balancing classes and levels for both teams in skirmish games is a joke. Sometimes it will give more/better tanks to one side or give one side tons of paratroopers. It also doesn't balance player levels properly so newbies often get seal clubbed. It makes for imbalanced and frustrating gameplay if you are a newbie.  Also, the game is riddled with cheating. There are several cheating programs that you can easily find on the Internet which reveal the locations of all enemy players and puts boxes around them, making camoflage/cover almost useless and allowing you to always get the drop on an enemy. I've seen people with 20 or even 30 to 1 K/D in a game. As it is so easy to die in this game, I can imagine that those players were using these programs.  Overall, this game really isn't worth investing any serious time into unless you like pay-to-win games and have the cash to pay so you can win. If you're looking for a free-to-play game that doesn't bone you for not spending tons of cash, look elsewhere. This game is not for you.",-1,0

It has solid graphics and sound, with easy to identify and well charactered units. Base building is a charm with the power-node system, and the resource distribution (four types!) forces exploration and additional base-building. The game borrows some of the best ideas from StarCraft, Generals, Tiberium Sun and Supreme Commander, and balances them out extremely well; it's less macro-y, faster, and less fiddly than Age Of Empires, but less micro-y, speedfreak tournament hotkey nonsense than StarCraft or Dawn Of War.  It really feels like some of the best bits of the C&amp;C Games, (sneaking transports into the back of enemy bases), but with a little more depth, and it just has a really solid, classic RTS feel that's familiar, yet fresh at the same time.  This one is a hidden gem, and has sleeper hit written all over it. Multiplayer is probably going to be a *blast* with this game.  ",1,1

105600,Terraria,"*WARNING: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*  Terraria is the kind of game that can be played over and over without getting boring. I love how the game has a pre-set determined path of events that you have to do in order to keep ranking up in health or loot. First, you pretty much mine until you have enough gold/platinum to create swords, armor, and other weapons. The next step is to fight the Eye of Cthulhu and the Brain of Cthulhu/Eater of Worlds. After that point, you pretty much have enough supplies to go explore the Dungeon and after getting that loot, proceeding on to the underworld. This game just gets extremely fun after this point, in which you find more supprising loot and bosses such as the Destroyer.  I also like how there are 3 main builds of a character:  The melee build, The ranged build, and last but not least: The magic build.  Each class brings a new way of playing the game and new items become better to use than before, if you used all 3 different class weapons at one time. If you use only one build's items at a time, such as a pistol and a suit of necro armor, the pistol will be more effective in eliminating the enemy force.  I've been with this game since before 1.2, and I do have to say that it has gotten way more advanced over the years. There are plenty of items to be found and a large range of enemies that you will encounter over the time that you spend playing through this game.  I think this game is well worth the cost, and if it is on sale, I say you should buy it right there and then.

The structure is a little weird as it's kind of open and you can sort of backtrack to older puzzles once you've acquired a certain mechanic/object etc etc. I like open-ended games, but I just think that it's easy to lose your way when navigating through different puzzles.

I really appreciate the attention to detail in this game, especially in the emails that describe a lot about modern China that can be a real surprise for Westerners who haven't been there (recently), or the craziness of the electronics market in Shenzhen (it's far, far, far more crazy than whatever you are imagining right now), or the instructions that are only listed in the Chinese version of the data sheets (I even asked my wife to translate one of these from the manual), or even just how to pronounce Shenzhen.

240760,Wasteland 2,"So, if you take the term 'CRPG' really seriously and enjoy getting in fights about how modern RPGs aren't 'real' RPGs, and you wish it were still the late 1990s, this is a great game for you and you don't need to read the rest of my review.  On the other hand, if you enjoy isometric party-based RPGs but also might like to see some progress from the last 15 years or so of gaming history, Wasteland 2 is kind of a letdown precisely because of how stubbornly it emulates the UI fiddliness of Fallout 1/2. Get ready to remember which party member owns a shovel, switch to them, activate the shovel item, and wait while a progress bar fills up, every time you want to dig something up. And this isn't just shovels, it's *every specialized skill*. You're not realistically going to put together a party with more than one girl or guy who knows Safecracking or some other random ♥♥♥♥, but the game will never let you just click on the safe and have the one Safecracker open it.  The maps suffer from a similar level of fiddliness. You will have to memorize where in town that random questgiver is, or come back from a fetch quest to wander all over wondering where his shop is among a town of identical-looking dwellings. No quest markers is fine, I don't think that the player should have telepathic knowledge of where stuff is ahead of time, but when you're looking to turn in quests (and the characters would already know where shopkeeper X is) it's just a hassle. Isometric design also means that the level designers hide crates in places where you need to rotate the camera to find them ... which is fine, but after a while, it's not clever, it's just irritating to have to rotate the camera every time you enter a new room or potentially miss out on loot.  I could go on with examples of the weird sort of micromanagement that Wasteland 2 requires of the player (there are many more), but you get the point.  Bottom line, it feels like a game that came out in 2000, not 2014. If you're fine with this, go ahead and get it (but you probably already did). If you're not, and especially if you haven't played Fallout 1/2 to death, there's really no reason to play this instead of Fallout 1/2.",-1,0

I'm a huge fan of Syberia series, and was really excited to play this one. The sceneries artwork is what really makes this game stand out. The colors, lighting and details are well thought through, together creating wonderful atmosphere to play in.  However, this game lacks details and realism in character animation, which made the game pretty hilarious and at the same time annoying to watch during the conversations. Another slightly frustrating feature is the random calls and hunger attacks on main character (especially frustrating when it's mid-conversation), which interrupt your progress.  But overall, I think it's a great and highly underrated adventure game.  ",1,0

AI is balanced so game stays fun and delivers a challenge at the same time. Enemies are communicating, reporting by radio when going to check a suspicious person or noises. Others are going to look for their missing colleague if he didn't return or radio back. Firefights might be easier, but try to earn S- rank at hard difficulty, that's a challenge!

379720,DOOM,"This is pretty much the real Doom 3, and the best FPS game in years besides Shadow Warrior. DOOM is all about staying on the move while strategizing how you're going to kill this wave of demons, the further you are in the game the harder it gets which means the more you have to use your brain. Every player will know this about the last wave of demons before you leave Hell to get back to Mars. There is a power up for Quad Damage to not pick it up until the giant red demons with horns come out at the end, finish off the little bit of smaller demons with the plasma rifle and then use the chainsaw to instant kill 1 out of the 2 big horned demons so you only have 1 demon left and just have fun with him.  -Now on with the pros and cons.  Pros:  -Badass soundtrack -Kickass Demons -weapon and suit upgrades -A true classic brought into the new generation -Finishing kills are always different going at different angles including when jumping on them from above -Very well worth your hard earned money which is rare for games these days  Cons:  -Multiplayer -chainsaw runs out of fuel fast and the fuel for it is rare to find.

I started to like action RPGs after playing Elder Scrolls Skyrim, and as I finished the game I was looking for something similar, and well.. I found this game. I was not very sure about this game, it starts very bland but put a few hours to it and you would love it. the cities are bigger than the Skyrim's towns, its a free-to-explore, open world RPG and its massive! the story is very good and the game is addictive, a true solid RPG. there are a few problems though, some dialogues with NPCs are a little bland, the horse riding is stupid and the menus are a tad confusing. dont get me wrong, after a few hours you would start to enjoy it and it can be a good replacement for elder scrolls series. combat is very good and fun, magic is awesome, crafting and forging is very good and you have all the cool stuff like alchemy, enchanting (sort of!), upgarding weapons and customizing your character. there are guilds to join, and tons of quests to do. dungeons, demons, undead creatures, necromancers, everything you would want from a RPG. take my advice and buy it, you will love it as much as I do!  oh, and i almost forgot; this game has a true FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT!!",1,0

201830,Jurassic Park: The Game,"I died a lot. But I was ok with that. Sometimes the death animations were cool. If your aim is to get gold on every sequence, then you might find it incredibly frustrating, and not fun.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first episode. I died a lot and missed a lot of quick time events, but the game was pretty forgiving about it.  I’m playing on OSX 10.8.5 and my controller doesn’t work, at all. There doesn’t seem to be any options to switch to a controller from a keyboard, either. The game runs pretty smoothly most of the time, but occasionally it will just suddenly crash to desktop. One time the game seemed to get kind of confused, and I had to force quit the game.  The shadows look really pixelated, and I have the settings all the way up.  The game is an odd sort of mix of quick time events and simple puzzles. There’s not much of a challenge, and the quick time events can be a little frustrating, but the visuals and the music and the vocals and sound design are all masterfully done.  To me, it’s more of an interactive experience, than a game, and it’s an experience that I enjoyed.  There is one choice that matters and it comes in the last sequence of the game. It doesn't matter much, but it will determine which of 2 endings you receive.",1,0

264730,Deadly 30,"Important- This game had some serious performance issues for me until I followed this FAQ.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=260668911  Now everything runs smoothly. It's still an annoying bug for many though, and I hope the devs make a permanent fix.  Deadly 30 is a blend of tower defense and run-and-gun zombie shooter. Very simple mechanics to the point of being a time-waster, but entertaining with a somewhat unusual flow of gameplay that I'd love to see more of in the future. Basically, your time is split into days and each day consists of a morning, afternoon, dusk, and night. Your choices during each phase will dictate whether you can survive to the next day. The first two phases are relatively peaceful, a time spent upgrading your base, weapons, and abilities then venturing out into the lands surrounding your base to collect supplies from enemies or scrappable structures. All of your effort is put toward becoming strong enough to survive that night. You can also run into allies that will join your cause. There is an element of luck as you never know if that day will yield plentiful resources and spawn needed allies, lack of both can result in some very hectic nights. In later chapters, dusk is usually spent fighting off enemies as you hurry back to the base to hopefully upgrade some stuff in time for the night phase. The nights of the game are spent facing a giant slew of zombies, ideally you make it back to base in time to set and upgrade some blockades to serve as a distraction while you pick them off zombies by the hundreds. As you successfully complete each night you can gain access to new upgrades, level up, and view tiny and very goofy cut-scenes. There are also a wide variety of zombie types that are unlocked almost every other day. This is a short game but the frequency of new upgrades/enemies/weapon types are regular and keep the pace running well.   For me this game is a lot of fun in the short bursts it can be played, but too shallow and simple to have real longevity. It's disappointing to discover for example, that the various explorable areas are all the same but for palette swaps, and don't contain any defining unique features like bosses, hidden areas, or unique items- content is plunked down randomly.   At the end of the day, the concept is what remains compelling about Deadly 30 and is one I'd like to see in future games. I'm a big fan of games that integrate day and night systems in meaningful way, time management features make every moment count, the 'just one more day' flow of gameplay keeps things addictive, and the element of randomness to each day is not unlike the joy of each run in roguelikes. The difficulty of Deadly 30 is on the low side though. While death comes easily and some zombie types are colossally strong, the game is pretty lenient on failure. Each successful night is autosaved and you can repeat a failed day. If you really run into an unbeatable situation, starting from a new game saves a lot of progress and should result in a much more success.  This game has been on sale or bundled a lot lately, it's worth the money in my opinion but I hope future updates or sequels expand significantly on the depth of the world, and strategic options and aspects to help offset the repetitive and monotonous nature of the combat. Overall, a fun and strangely relaxing shooter/survival hybrid.",1,0

237740,Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures,"Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures is a 2D, 8 bit retro style 'torture' platformer. After a brief tutorial level to kickoff the game, it opens up to eight selectable levels. A few are far easier than others. There is a lot of parody going on here. Levels reminiscent of old Nintendo games like Castlevania, Metroid, Super Mario Bros 2 and Zelda 2. You'll even find an 8 bit parody of dirty Atari games. Once you complete those eight, then the final LJN style level gets revealed. It is all based on the comedy from the Angry Video Game Nerd web series that has been around for a decade. Its a good game that doesn't offer any unique features that aren't found in other Nintendo games. If you're looking for something fresh and original gameplay wise, you won't find it here.  The game plays a lot like Mega Man. Jump, shoot (with no autofire), duck and use a special item. The only difference is there is 8 way shooting like Contra. You can even hold the trigger to plant your feet so you don't walk as you aim diagonal. The items are few and far between. The tutorial level will walk you through all them. Glitch gremlin that I think kills everything killable on screen? Seven hours into the game and I still don't know for sure. Super Mecha Death Christ definitely kills everything on screen. Things like a rock that do little to no damage. Its just in the game so the Nerd can make a joke. The Nerd can even pick up a superscope weapon that does more damage, but one hit and you've lost it. A lot of times you'll find it in areas with unkillable enemies.  Even as a torture platformer, the game isn't that difficult. Timing is key. More than missing a jump, its missing a jump at the wrong time might get you hit and you'll fall in a pit. Each level is around 10 minutes. You have health measured in beer. Pick up a beer to restore your health. On easy you can walk into enemies with no regard for your life. Normal difficulty and up you have to have skills to not die from health loss. Each enemy causes you to get knocked back which becomes deadly if a pit is around. With that being said, the majority of deaths come from death blocks. Mega Man 2 had spikes, AVGN has deathblocks. These are everywhere! Some are in the ground. Somme are moving. Some are on and off with a timer. Some appear only when you get close to them. If you're not paying attention, to where you step, you're dead!  Nin-Toasters get used as checkpoints. These are pretty frequent. When you die, you respawn, but not after seeing a death screen with a randomly generated death phrase that usually involves an animal, a fluid and an body hole. You cannot turn off these death screens. It could be to hide a loading screen. You need to see it for a few seconds before pushing jump to get back to the action. Most torture platformers just drop you right back into the action.  Each level is pretty straight forward, but still allows for exploration here and there. You'll even find three extra characters to play as. Each has their own style and can be toggled on the fly with the shoulder bumpers. Mike has a high Luigi jump and can use a short range light sabre to break through walls that get highlighted as you draw near. He also makes invisible platforms appear. Couch Guy has a wave attack from his guitar that will go through blocks when the Nerd's gun can't. His jump is short, so he's better for SHMUP sections of the game. Finally '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' has a double jump and a short range arced attack, but can't jump as high as the Nerd. He's good for accessing different areas. For the most part, these extra characters are only used for finding secret areas, that have cameos from other ScrewAttack friends along with plenty of beer and 1-ups.  The enemies feel diverse, but there isn't a huge variety. Each level swaps out enemy sprites. High bouncing enemies, enemies that attract to you, wave pattern enemies, floor spikes that shoot up, hovering enemies, circular flying unkillable fireballs and so on. Each level has its own unique big enemies. Snowmen that belch giant snowballs. Giant turd balls that spit dookie at you in Hell. Axe throwers in the Castlevania level. Each enemy's death had particle effects that felt satisfying. At the end of each level is of course a boss, straight from AVGN's history of evil. Jason Vorhees, Satan, Dr. Jekyll / Mister Hyde, General Custer and so on. Most of the bosses just fly in a figure eight pattern.  Unlike most torture platformers, there was dynamic gameplay. Going from a platformer to a sidescrolling SHMUP. Riding down a hill one a dead corpse, streaking blood behind you. Hopping on a giant laser shark and tearing through lava. These were all a lot of fun to break up the levels. Even with each level having its own theme, there were things gimmick wise to make them stand out. The Castlevania level has a series of timed on and off death blocks. The dirty Atari level has bouncing platforms under your feet. The snow level had ice to slide on. The Zelda 2 level had keys to unlock doors. The haunted level has moving block platforms like Super Mario World and darkness outside of a short illumination around the Nerd. The Mega Man future level had timed laser beams and timed on / off platforms. It was able to keep the challenges dynamic.  It is no doubt a good game for fans that like Mega Man's gameplay. There are just little things that get in the way. The text box at the bottom of the screen with the Nerd talking is a distraction and obscures the action. In fact, the entire game is just a distraction. There are laser lights panning through some levels. Things flying everywhere. Even a vomit inducing waterfall ala Super Mario Bros 2. Half a dozen fireballs flying in a circle, bouncing on platforms, while enemies float toward you! Its all very busy, but that's probably to keep your eyes off the death blocks! The comedy also misses its mark, but I feel a lot of comedy games aren't that funny. Maybe its lacking the Nerd's delivery. Its just not as funny in text form when I'm too busy playing the game to read it.  Playing normal mode first took 2 hours for the first 8 levels and 4 hours for the final level. I sank around 100 lives just for the final boss. Then I discovered how to plant my feet by holding the trigger to shoot diagonal without walking. Normal difficulty gives you unlimited continues and 30 lives. I felt the intensity when I had died 10 times on a boss and I was coming to my final life to beat him. Easy difficulty gives you more health and unlimited lives ensuring you'll get through the game. There are higher difficulties, but normal was enough for me. I have a feeling you can complete easy difficulty in under 2 hours.  To summarize, its the best AVGN game you could hope for. Easy difficulty makes it so everyone can complete the game. If it wasn't for easy difficulty I wouldn't recommend it. I'd recommend it more for fans of old Nintendo games than AVGN fans. If you're into 8-bit Nintendo games, especially Mega Man. Get it. Also take note that 50% of players have the 100 deaths achievement. So does that mean on easy mode they beat it in under 100 lives or did they just give up and not complete it?",1,1
273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Evolve caught my attention right from the day of its announcement. I followed this game for months, living off a trickle of previews and videos; I never had the privilege of being able to play the beta. I wanted this game so badly, never even having tried it, that I paid 700 rand for it before launch. And you know what?...  It was worth it.  Because, good god, it's a terrifying, exhilirating, stalking, stomping beast of a game. Evolve looks great, but more importantly it feels great - it feels great to run and leap for your life through alien jungles, to be this huge and powerful thing and pounce upon your prey, beating them down without mercy. It also feels great to be in a team hunting this huge and powerful thing, following a trail of footprints, broken bodies and carnage while dodging lesser dangers and watching each other's backs, until the time comes for a final showdown where the strength of your teamwork is put to the test. The best part is, until you're in the thick of it, it's impossible to know who's hunting who.  Evolve is addictive fun and it knows how to make my heart beat like crazy; it makes we want to cheer when I win a hard-earned victory, and it makes me want to try again when I fail. I don't care that there's a bunch of stupidly expensive skins there for people who want to advertise that they have money to burn - quite refreshingly, in fact, this game hasn't tried to sell me anything since I bought it, which works out great because it came packed with content that I've yet to see and I can't see it getting old anytime soon. On top of that, it's easy to find a match whenever I feel like playing, the players are usually considerate and helpful and I've yet to be insulted or trolled by anyone.  I. LOVE. THIS. GAME.

There still isn't a competently balanced difficulty setup, every civilization runs the same strategy, with very little regard for leader identity. Leader identity should be a core focus, but it's just ignored. Civ 6 promised a new Casus Belli system, which has turned out to be just new ways to be declared a war mongerer by everyone else. You can now be invited into a joint war and then declared a war mongerer by the civilization that asked you to join the joint war. The company in-charge has no public-face, which means they don't value their gamers. I wonder where the creativity went in game design.",-1,1

228280,Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition,"To begin with, I still declare Baldur's Gate to be one of my favourite games of all time. I have been playing it since the early 2000's before the Enhanced Edition and thoroughly enjoy the series.  The original game was riddled with bugs, compatibility issues and multiple other large problems for modern gaming and a remake of the game was very promising. The Enhanced Edition added multiple new quests, classes and boosted the level cap whilst also acting as a major bug fix. This was very well recieved but it still wasn't perfect, just very good. The remake kept closely to the original with some neccesary changes and fixes. The repairment and ease of the multiplayer mode was the cherry on top, allowing for groups of friends to adventure together in a wonderful story and detailed world. The added areas, game mode and voice actors were unsettling at first, but easy to warm up to and even enjoy the variety before you.  The remake of the sequel had near enough the same changes allowing it to be a must-buy for owners of the first game.  However, Siege of Dragonspear.... This DLC came with a list of bug fixes, UI changes and all other changes that completely ruined my experience of the game. They somehow managed to make the game look uglier than a half-orc and act as smart as a goblin. The AI now is only useful in non-stressful multi-opponent fights, of which there are few in the DLC, and they destroyed the multiplayer mode to be non-functioning for a lot of people. This coupled with the completely game braking bugs that you can find within the first ten minutes of gameplay have essentially taking the Baldur's Gate that we know and love and turned it into a small pile of trash. Not to say it isn't a good game, the DLC's storyline is good and takes a large chunk of time, achievement hunting is both humorous and fun and a couple of the new NPC's are funny and useful. But it is far from the game we all fell in love with. tl;dr It is a great game but riddled with bugs, inconsistencies in most aspects and the DLC is only worth it for the achievments and die-hard story fans.",1,0

352400,LEGO® Jurassic World,"I got this game to play with my wife. She was really into SNES and Genesis as a kid all the way until Halo on the original XBox, but since then she sort of backed out of gaming. We are both huge Jurassic Park fans and I thought this would be a fun game to play together. So glad I got it. It's been a while since I have been able to play a game with my wife where we lose track of time and need to make ourselves turn it off.  The game is surprisingly all movies in the franchise. In the begenning you get to play wither Jurassic Park 1 or Jurassic World. After beating JP1, you unlock JP2! Very excited when that happened!   The game plays like most Lego games, and borrows all audio from the movies (at least in the cases of JP1 &amp; JP2) and for a huge JP fan, this is actually a plus. They stick the films rather well and but with a light hearted twist. You'll see what I mean during the 'SHOOT HER!!' scene.  I have no problem buying this at full price.

282140,SOMA,"Loved it. The horror comes from making difficult choices that only you can rationalise and justify to yourself.   Good: Great immersion, setting, atmosphere, level design, aesthetics, sound, interesting story. Empathised quite a lot with the characters, present and absent. To me everything seemed to make sense (in the context of the game).  OK: Adequate graphics. Not as pretty as Alien: Isolation, but definitely good enough for the job. Definitely did not get boring or drag out too long. Some of the puzzles, enemies &amp; exploration can be confusing/frustrating but I think it stays within the bounds of what makes sense. Fairly short, but it's of the 'short and sweet' flavour. You may feel that your choices have no impact on the game, but the point is that your choices should have an impact on  you .  Bad: Some voice acting feels flat or maybe not as expressive as could be. MC has a fixed perspective on things which disagreed with my own perspective. Some screen effects do make your eyes hurt.",1,0
248570,Toribash,"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1,1

212680,FTL: Faster Than Light,"If there's one game that thoroughly deserves to be paid more than ten bucks for, it'd be FTL. As it stands, the pricetag is amazing. It's a Roguelike and anyone who's ever been of the old cardboard and wood persuasion will know of the infamous Galaxy Truckers boardgame, which it is oddly reminiscent of. When you just start playing the rounds won't take too long, ten to twenty minutes or so. But as you actually become skilled and gain a feeling for how it works, the games will drag on for hours on end. This is a slower Roguelike, as evinced by Ben Prunty's absolutely-lovely-beyond-words OST. But dear lord will you have fun.  You're going to be given command of the Kestrel, pushed from a giant battle to warn earth of the impending fleet the enemy is sending after their resounding victory. The game allows you to re-crhisten the ship though, and the UEFC 'Psyentific' has had her maiden voyage about four hundred times by now - as has its crew.  The poor thing comes with only limited fuel and supplies, and it straddles the line between risk and reward the same way your crazy ex girlfriend always used to. Are you gonna make that extra jump or two to send aid to that HELP beacon that keeps blipping? Are you going to ignore your conscience, play it safe and just head for the sector's warp gate? They might have what you need. You're low on fuel and they could just have a busted thruster pack with a full tank of space JP-8. Maybe they have ammunition for your missile pods? Extra drones they don't need? Oh man maybe they have  weapons .  So you make the jump, and you're about to present yourself as the saviour of all things research vehicles, and    OH IT'S SODDING PIRATES  ",1,0

272040,KAMI,"Full review:  http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/kami-game-review/   KAMI is probably one of the more unique puzzle games that I’ve played as of late. The game has you folding paper, origami-style, to solve puzzles. The game’s title is the Japanese word for paper and I still have no idea how to pronounce it (I’ve been saying it like ‘CAM-E’).  The method used to solve each puzzle is why this game is so unique. Each puzzle starts you off with a square sheet of paper, much like origami, with this piece of paper being covered in small triangles of varying colors. Your objective is to make the entire sheet of paper one solid color in as little clicks as possible. There’s a color palette at the bottom of each puzzle and its your choice in deciding what color the end result should be, with that hopefully being the color netting you the least amount of clicks.  When you click on any triangle in the puzzle, any other triangle of the same color connected to the clicked triangle will change into the color you have selected. This is a bit difficult to explain, so I encourage you to look at videos, etc. This color-changing mechanic is accomponied by a neat-looking animation as well, which I would describe as a sea of paper-folding triangles.  The game’s major fault lies in the amount of content offered. I wish there were more puzzles to do, as there’s only 63. The game is $4 (on Steam) though, so that may be the reason. I ran out of puzzles rather quickly, although that can probably be attributed to the fact that I went for the bare minimum ranking in each puzzle, “okay”, instead of opting to go for the “perfect” ranking in each. There is another ranking as well, known as “fail”, and I’m sure you can figure what that means on your own.  The game’s difficulty curve is fantastic. Slowly increasing, but not to a completely frustrating point. If you’ve got time to kill, then I highly recommend KAMI. Although it may be short, it’s well-worth the unique experience. Oh, it’s also worth mentioning that the game does not fully display in widescreen, but instead has some rather thin black bars to the left and right. No idea why it wasn’t optimized for widescreen, wish it had been.",1,0

237930,Transistor,"Transistor. A game by Supergiant Games, the very same people who made Bastion. I was a little skeptical about this game when I first got it. I knew I was gonna love the story and the art but the combat system? After playing through for a while I got used to its very strange CS.  Overall I feel this is a great game. the CS is hard to get used to at first but once you master it, you're set. One issue I am having is that when I get to the Archives after defeating The Spine, I unlocked half of the area but when I go into the maintenance shaft my game freezes. And it has done so many, many times. Until I get past this snag I cannot post a full review of the game. If anyone has ideas on how to fix my issue please PM me.",1,0
214770,Guacamelee! Gold Edition,"Easily one of the best indie games i've ever purchased. If an action platformer, a beat em up, and metroidvania had a child this would be the child. In this game you fight and grapple the enemies, as well as using moves you unlock throughout the games. All of your moves can combo together. For example, I can use my upward punch, then jump up and rooster claw(upward attack that shoots you up too. This is useful all game to help you platform as well.), attack them multiple times, then either groundpound them, headbutt them away, or grapple them and follow up with one of my throws. I could always piledrive my enemy, kick them 20 feet away, or do a deadly suplex to help wipe out the enemies that might await below me.  The enemies have a good variety, even tho I wish it had more. I felt like with a little more variety amongst the enemies, this game would have been so much more fun.  For now, I'll give it a 8.5/10. I truly recommend this gem of a game, on sale or off.

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"The game runs better now but there are still some issues such as frame drops, lag, and host migrations. It's 2015, why am I not on a dedicated server?

Why do I reload when sprinting? Why can't I have different streaks (and specialists) with each loadout like in mw3 and ghosts? Why is stock so slow compared to other CoD's? Stock needs to be buffed with about 50% of what it is now for all weapons, because as of right now, it is pretty much useless. Ante Up should be like Black ops 2 Hardline, and that is all I'm gonna say about that. Fix it!   Small little things like this not working properly boils down to a rather annoying online experience where you're left scratching your head: 'Why don't the developers see this before the game comes out?'.

This game knows what it is and doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't, it embraces everything that made the DOOM series legendary and builds upon it with a soundtrack that is one of the most enjoyable I've listened to in a long time. The only flaw I can think of is the map controls are a bit annoying to use but it's such a minor niggle you should not let that put you off. This game is ♥♥♥♥ing epic.

331470,Everlasting Summer,"this game...holy ♥♥♥♥ this game. Usually I'm not a fan of reading or virtual stories but holy ♥♥♥♥ is this game ♥♥♥♥ing incredible. I say this because of the immersion and character developement of the different people around you during those seven days. This game has some incredible story telling worthy or ranking above and beyond Life is Strange and The Walking Dead. There is also some amazing content and hidden story for the theorists of the world to uncover about this game like: where you are, why you are here and what this place is. The game also had some very creepy and dark themes to it like the old camp grounds which you visit on day 4. The diversity of all the characters and seeing them all thrown into one place just made the 'game' so much more enjoyable.  Cons- Of course no game is without its problems so here are a some of the problems I found. dificult to find specific endings for characters alone, the game has some incredible points in the story which it doesn't elaborate in too much detail and I found it difficult to 'like' some of the characters introduced.  Overall I highly reccomend this game to EVERYONE even if its just to try it out or 'go out on a limb.' the game portrays and excellent contrast with the Russian setting compared to Russia at the time. This game is PERFECT for anyone even if you're not a fan of these types of games seeing as its a much more relaxed and calm experience which can still get very tense or creepy. So go download this game and PLAY IT, I cannot reccommend this game anymore",1,0

No choice is between evil and good. And no choice is forcefully gray and morally ambiguous the way BioWare does it. Choices are complex and have deep consequences.

359320,Elite Dangerous,"This game has great potential but its design and the way it is built right now is a joke. Extremely unfriendly for new players and kind of empty. What I like about it: The graphics, the fast loading times, the freedom it gives you and the abiltiy to do what you want, the control with a joystick and thruster and space battles (it just is fun).  What I don't like...well:  Steep learning curve - it will take you a while to learn most of the things in this game. Almost nothing is explained. Missions are extremely vague, bugged, and annoying. Find and kill X, Location: Space. Great.  Another example Find X Canisters of Whatever. You find them but the mission can't continue because they're apparently not the ones you need, even though you got them from the system it said.  There's no real content, lots of grinding. Little to no player interactions, no guilds, no voice chats except on Wings. No voice chats on the AI, they communicate through text messages. Really not immersive.  You get pulled out of hyperspace on almost every trip, it becomes a nuissance after the first 10 times. You get stopped, you destroy the idiot, you continue. Just a waste of time. Some stations and destinations are really ♥♥♥♥ing far away from each other, 150 000Ls away takes you 10 minutes of sitting doing nothing at all. And it's apparently another star with other planets, so basically another system. Why can't I just ♥♥♥♥ing warp there?  Coop and Wing play is a joke. Frequent disconnects. Game lags. Your Wing suddenly disappears. The game freezes for no reason.  You can't play coop in open play, only private groups, what's the ♥♥♥♥ing purpose then? Did I mention players are rare? It's mostly a single player or coop game (when it works).  All in all it was worth 13 euros for the time I spent in it, but it could've been a lot more pleasant. Not worth more than 20 eur, even with expansions. Oh, and they charge separately for ship paint jobs and other crap. Not cool.",-1,0

Emily is Away is a short (I completed it in about thirty minutes), feel-good game that makes you think and savor the moment. It has five different chapters of the game, the first chapter set in your last year of high school, the last chapter set in your last year of college. In this game you unfortunately must play as a male, Emily being female, and you face the ups and downs of friendship. Although you do have choices in this game, they do not seem to affect the ending of this game. Overall I recommend this game. ",1,0

506140,Shop Heroes,"I missed the launch day for Steam on 15th and got on the 16th, first time on and spent 4 straight hours. Later that day spent another 2 straight hours and 6 more hours on the 17th. Now the 18th spent 2 more straight hours playing... It's only 6AM, I have so much more time.  The game is simple, a ton of multitasking and nothing to stop you from continuesly playing if you know how to micromanage. Those straight hours of playing I did was that short because I forced myself to stop and take a break.  You play the role of a mayor for a city ( starting out is pretty much a village) and you try to build up everything by making investments with the gold you earn through sending heroes on quests to gather tiny bit of gold and materials, having smiths, leatherworkers, crafters of all sorts making equipment for customers, and finally making sales through the market.  Some say 'It's a waiting game'. Yeah if you can't micromanage you will get stuck in long waits.  Example...  You have 12 wood and 12 iron. The first customer wants a 'Maul' (costs 5 wood[58sec]), second customer wants a 'Sledgehammer' (8 wood, 2 shiny gems[1min 46sec]). You don't have the shiny gems nor enough wood to make both weapons.  You can...  A) Craft the 'Maul' and wait over your resources to refill and craft the 'Sledgehammer' next. OR B) Craft 2 'Mauls' saving 2 wood but it takes 1min 56sec.  So you spend 10 more seconds of waiting but have 2 wood left over for say crafting 2 'Clubs' which is 5secs each.  Not every customer will come in all at once but one after another or a min after the first so you can already be crafting one item and another customer steps in so you start that one then 2 more come in and you start theirs then the first is done so you cash in on it. This constant switch can be endless if you know how to MICROMANAGE.  That is just dealing with the customer now you sent some heroes on a few quests that from the first 2 quests take around 5-10mins. If you micromanage this will fly by.  So you keep track of...  - Resources (early on is Wood, Iron, Leather, or if you chose druid as your third worker herbs) - Stockpile of weapons and armour - Heroes on Quests - Current wait time on equipment - What customer to sell to first or what to sell to them  The customers alone have some features you should keep track of and figure out how you want to deal with on a buisness level. Discount, Surcharge, Compliment, Refuse, Suggest, and From Trade.  Discount : You lower price you request for the item you are selling to them (Gain more energy) Surcharge : You charge more for the item you are selling to them (Lose more energy) Compliment : This is seemingly random, you may gain or lose energy with this Refuse : You turn down their request and lose or gain nothing, Takes longer for them to return. Suggest : Suggest a different item to the customer (Lose energy) From Trade : You can buy the requested equipment from the market but can cost more then the sale  With these factors now you run into points such as...  I can't craft what he wants but I can make the next best thing which will lose energy but if I discount it then I make a profit of energy and still make some gold.  You also can buy equipment racks that increase how much energy you get from selling those types of equipment on the rack...  So if the customer wanted a Sledgehammer and you only could make him a Maul but you also have a Mace equipment rack then you can Surcharge the Maul and still make a profit of energy or lose no energy at all with the customer and you make a great profit!  Important bit 'Energy' Ah that sounds like a restriction most facebook games have that control how long you get to play so you are forced either to wait hours or pay with real money to continue. NO! It doesn't work that way here.  You have several factors I just covered here that will allow you to always have energy! If you just sell the items the customer wants you lose and gain no energy and crafting COSTS NO ENERGY!",1,1

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Keep in mind, i have finished the game after writing this review. This game is broken. If you hate games that feel like they havent been tested, then stay away. There are countless glitches in this game. The controls for keyboard and mouse suck, but you might get used to them, even though your cursor is always on your screen. The framerate is not great and gets horrible (like below 15) when you get to Seath.   Its community defend it with the stupidest phrases. 'its not meant to be played on keboard and mouse' then why is it on pc? if they would have made the cursor be able to dissapear and make the target switching less sensitive, it wouldnt be as bad. 'if you dont want your frames to drop, use the 60fps mod' if you need to mod the game to get it to work properly then your game has a problem. Its hard, yes, sometimes stupidly hard. I can respect a difficult game, but diffictulty shouldnt come from bad controls and framerate issues, it should come only from the game itself,   The lock on system favors the strangest targets. It wont lock to the person in fron of you, it will target the person down the stairs and behind a wall that you cant see, and if you're on keyboard and mouse (you can actually play without the mouse, but i wanted to use it) slightly moving the mouse will cause targets to switch. With multiple enemies, this can cause your camera to freakout. Speaking of the camera, it suffers from what most 3rd person games suffer from, not being able to see whats in fron of you because the camera is blocked. This is hell on the decent to blightown.   The random invasions are very annoying as well. apparently very high level people still camp lower level areas to invade any possible new players to prey on them, cause, well you know, its the internet.  You can occasionaly find yourself having fun in this and the game gets much easier the farther it goes, and if you know what to get, (or just constanly explore like me) it can be more fun. Pyromancy, Havel armor set, and the black knights sword= a walking tank that no boss stands a chance from.  Its dangerous to go alone so take this piece of advice, dont play it. I did, had a bit of fun but i just needed to kill time. I 'got gud' played that 'dank souls', 'tried jumping' and for the love of god saw 'praise the sun' at least 100 times. ♥♥♥♥ the sun, ♥♥♥♥ the sun and its covenant in particular- Sicerely The Moon.

Its challenging.   - Cons This game, (the way I saw it anyway) depends a LOT on luck.  Even though the graphics are fun ans really suit the game, They should improve it a bit.   8/10   ---DETAILS---  This is a card-strategy game with elements of RPG, delver and dungeon building. The story is prety fun so far and the characters are funny, they actually made me giggle a few times.    Lets split it a bit.  Soundtrack: Simply awesome. Everytime a hero dies, wins a dungeon or when you start the game, the music just blows my mind. It really fits the atmosphere of the game! Congratulations to the developers! 10/10  Graphics: Pretty cool, but not awesome. Its kinda of repetitive, even though whenever you equip a new equipment to a hero it changes the display, everything else stays the same. 8/10  Gameplay: The gameplay consists on 3 parts:  1. Building your guild. The gold you get from dungeons you use to upgrade your guild, allowing you to get more heroes, blessings, different loot in dungeons. You can also check your graveyard and trophy room. Nice features, good mechanics to upgrade, but the visual effects and the higher tier upgrades cost are kinda of lame. 9/10  2. Building the dungeon. At the beggining of the 'round' you receive 5 cards. There are creatures cards, dungeos area cards and treasure cards. You can put 3 of them into play. The idea is to use these 3 cards to build the dungeon, place enemies and treasures for you hero to find. The cards you get are mostly based on luck. Wich SUCKS. Sometimes you only get stupid cards, like 3 areas that only connect to 1 area and 2 creatures that can kick your ♥♥♥ as encounters. I got to say that dependiong entirely on luck kinda bummed me out. 7/10.  3. Movement of the hero and battles. You dont control the hero movement, he ALWAYS take the shortest route to complete the dungeon objective. Easy to understand. The harder the dungeon, the longer the dungeon you must create for him to get there, but the cards you receive to create the dungeon are random, remember? This can SUCK sometimes. Ok, now for the battle system. Its a card battle system. Each of your heroes start with a deck of cards that is the standard for that 'class'. You CANNOT change the deck before the dungeon. It's ALWAYS the same. When you win a battle, you will get some sort of equipment. The equipments will then add cards/give more health to your character. All the equipment is lost once you complete/fail a dungeon. So you always start with the same deck. The battle themselves are fun, but sometimes EXTREMELY frustrating.  You start the battle with 3 cards and you can see the card that you enemy is going to play, with that you can choose the best card for the ocasion. The battles are in 'real time' by that I mean that its not turn based. When you chose your card, yours and the enemies card are used at the same time, unless you use a quick card, wich makes you use it first. Once again, everything is based on luck, but that is to be expected, since its a card based battle, but it kinda takes a bit of the charm of the game. Since it is luck based you can be defeated by some stupid monsters, that you placed and was sure that was going to defeat it. 8/10  Gamplay overall: 24/30  ",1,0

214560,Mark of the Ninja,"I was so pleased that Klei made this...thing... This is the best platformer to come IN YEARS and one of my personal best games of ALL TIME (yyyyyyyeah...)! Graphically the game is amazing, the graphic style is a cartoony-like art style, it's so fun, cutscenes looks particularly amazing! Absolutely shockingly beautiful! I hate watching cutscenes and skip them mostly, but Mark of The Ninja is so different, I watched them all! They are funny, character animations and so good and cool! I love it! Usually indie games f*ck up story right? Yeah Mark of the Ninja nailed storyline! It's SO good! You have a huge twist in the end that makes you think about everything you've done until then and it made me sit in my chair for 10 minutes strait looking at my damn screen thinking which ending I should pick (there are 2 endings...). It's quite mindblowing I must say, last time I felt like that was with Bioshock Infinite (Infinite mindblew me a bit more though :P). Gameplay is also stellar, the map layout/design is incredible, you can take so many routes to reach your objective, there are so many different paths! It's incredible how they pulled this off! The controls are also amazingly fluid and responsive, unlike most stealth games, a sight for sore eyes! The game is also pure stealth-like, and by this I mean you can finish the game without killing anyone (except 'boss' targets, and even some you can choose not to kill, rather steal their info or something like that, really genius!). The game also has a bit of an RPG like system, where you get scored based on your level performance (don't worry it's much better done than Hitman: Absolution!), you also have some collectibles to find and objectives during the mission (like destroy 20 light in this mission or get to the end of the level without getting detected), very well thought and Future Soldier-like with I really loved in Future Soldier! It adds replayability! Anyways, with all those collectibles, scores, challenges completed you will be awarded a certain number of points (up to 9) where you can spend on new kill moves, tricks, hiding techniques, new equipment to use, like distraction flares, mines, etc. It's well thought and it encourages various styles of gameplay (between a murderous SOB to a sneaky pacifist, everything works!) Voice acting is also pretty good and you care about the characters, they have a personality and makes you get really into this ninja clan your character belongs to and what's happening and figure it all out. I though I covered pretty much everythign, the amazing skill point system, the amazing story, the amazing art style, the amazing character development, the amazing sound quality, the amazing and varied gameplay, the amazing and fluid controls! I think that the only think left to say is that there is a New Game +! To add even more replayablity! New Game + isn't shallow like in most games, hell no! Here it's fully implemented, your FOV is much lower (if you want to see if there a guard or something behind you you really need to turn back, if you want to see if there's someone below you, you need to look down, etc. This makes it a lot harder, besides the fact that in NG+ you die in one shot! so run like hell if you get spotted!  It's right now 14,99€ it's totally worth it at that full price, at any discount it's a steal! Like I said I was going to score a game if it was an amazing-truly-exceptional exception and Mark of the Ninja is EXACTLY THAT:  10/10! :D Get it now! It truly deserves the Metacritic score it got: 91 for an indie game? Wow It's the same as Fallout 3, more than any CoD game, more than The Witcher 2! It's not as good as Fallout 3 xD but it's really one of the games of the year and like I said one of the best games of all time. This IS true stealth! and like Destructoid said: 'Let it stand as the benchmark by which all stealth games are now measured.'  Or like GameInformer: 'Tense, strategic, and hard to put down, Mark of the Ninja is one of the welcome surprises of the year.'   Again! 10/10 on my list! I love it!",1,0

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"The followup of the already amazing game Demon's Souls takes what was great in that game and improves it, except the pvp system. Bosses and enemy design fits perfectly in the dark and abandoned world. The areas are over all brilliantly designed (yes, even Blighttown). Sadly the developers ran out of time finishing the game, which lead to less polished areas in the late game (Lost Izalith for example). The DLC made up for that though and we get to enjoy three of the best bosses in the entire series with Artorias being in my personal top 3.  Looking at some parts of that game that were rather frustrating (I'm talking to you Anor Londo archers on the roofs) it can be easy to just give up and not touch Dark Souls ever again (Ornstein and his Companion may be responsible for a lot of rage quits). Still that's part of the game and you as the player have to overcome the challenges and that's what makes this game so amazing. Dark Souls 1 was my first Souls experience ever, and oh boy did I die a lot. Still I never gave up and now I consider myself a very good PvE player (I suck at pvp)  I recommend this game to everybody who wants a true challenge and is not afraid of dying again and again :3",1,1

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"I'll start by saying it's a little rough around the edges currently in terms of polish, however as a total package, Chivalry is a really nice multiplayer game— especially for fans of the medieval theme.  Like many great multiplayer games out there, Chivalry is something that's easy enough to pick up, but hard to master. Combat in this game is deceptively deep, which proved to be a pleasant (albeit frustrating initially) surprise to me based on my premature impressions. Going into a fight flailing a weapon won't cut it in most situations. Timing plays a huge part both offensively and defensively, and learning how to play the different classes and effectively utilizing and countering each weapon in the arsenal is imperative to success.  So if you're a fan of multiplayer combat games and are looking for something fresh and unique from your everyday shooter, Chivalry is a good buy, and something that can provide countless hours of entertainment with the promise of free content patches in the future as well.",1,0
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"Returning to this game from Fallout 4 is dissapointing. Not for this game, but for the latter. This game seems to be better in nearly every aspect. Fallout 4 has better gun-play and character animations, but that's about the only thing it has above New Vegas. In New Vegas, the role playing elements are far better, the speech options are actually varied providing reason to upgrade skill paths more frequently such as speech, and even lack of upgrading the intelligence branch impacts speech choices. The graphics are subjective, but they seem better in New Vegas as well, targeting a more realistic look as opposed to Fallout 4 that changed to a more cartoonish look. There are also more gameplay aspects, such as repairing weaponry and equipment. Buy this game, it's easily worth the full asking price, and a steal during any sale.",1,0

Now, I don’t know about you, but there aren’t too many puzzle games that come to mind that can check off those same boxes. This game does something very special: it makes you want to solve puzzles, not just to get to the next level, but to progress in every sense of the term. Your character will gain access to better weapons, shields, and even potions which help all help customize the experience. 10,000,000 does all of this while being wrapped in a very basic pixel-art shell with music that is guaranteed to be stuck in your head for days.",1,0

205100,Dishonored,"I give this game a 3 out of 5. It gets some of the things right (like the story) and some things wrong (the blatant feminist propaganda throughout the game, and the occational spawning/despawning enemy).  (I will bring up the DLCs in their own section after the main review.)    SPAWNING / DESPAWNING  While many players get confused over guards filling in eachothers patrol routes, there are actual spawning/despawning in the game, which frustrates stealthy players who prefers to stake out their targets first, and/or players who use Dark Vision that is supposed to detect people through walls.  Examples:  - In the first level, after blowing up the wall, choking a guard will make an extremely high sound, and spawn guards from empty places, that will come to the rescue at a ridiculous speed. Every time you take one down, another one will appear. There is thus no way to rander all these guards unconscious.  - On the next level, at the warehouses behind the building, there's a scene where an overseer gets executed. All these three people are set to despawn as soon as you don't look at them anymore. One of them can open a door, you can look away, and when you look back, the door will even be closed.  - In the tower, a whale oil guard will spawn out of nowhere, dangerously close to a body storage room, and his route will almost ensure that he will spot you before you spot him.  - Swarms of rats can spawn on numerous occations, which requires you to sometimes hide away unconscious bodies on rooftops to ensure that no spawned swarm of rats will get to it.  - Corpses and unconscious bodies, will despawn when a similar body is created. While this will prevent piles of bodies to build up beyond 4-5, you can never be quite sure whether an unconscious body has simply despawned, or been eaten alive by rats (effectively meaning that you killed him and have to start the level over).  There's also bugs, such as the cellar chain at the hound pits starting to curl up, the pointer to an invitation being diplsayed despite the related scene that spawns it never taking place, and two Tallboys on the same level mysteriously ending up as corpses floating in the water in the beginning of the level.     MAKE THE FEMINIST VOICES STOP!  As for the feminism, all lower class women in this world is downtrodden because they are women (as your 'objectified' companion is 'happy' to point out) and the game throws every possible feminist scenario (hookers, ♥♥♥♥, romance stalking, sexual slavery, how much worse the country is when ruled by a man instead of a woman, and not a single mention of Emily's father) at you. You can actually get an instant game over from 'sexually' harassing a woman. It actually makes slitting the thoats of these overly victimized women oddly satisfying, because when you are being assaulted by feminist propaganda, the real enemy of this game becomes women, and if you kill all of them, then maybe the propaganda will finally stop.    TOO EASY  Also, this game is pretty casual. You have to be going for all the achievements, to make it challenging: Play it in the highest difficulty, never get seen, never kill, never buy anything, never use any powers, and aim to take out everyone. I'm talking about sedating the guard in front of a dog, and then move up to the dog to do a stealth takedown on it before it figures out what's going on.    HALF-LIFE 2 SET IN 1850  The Blink ability has had a negative impact on the setting of this game. As the characters can jump and use Blink (and sometimes doublejump with the Agility ability), in order to make places out of reach, the level designers had to make everything really, really tall. You have five meter tall bookshelves, wagons and cars that looks horribly elongated, and barrels who my grandmother could topple by just leaning against it.  The scenery itself, is just Half-Life 2 combines ripped straight off. This is Half-Life 2: Episode 3, set in the 1850s.    EXCELLENT LEVEL DESIGN  What barely makes up for all of the games annoying things, is the level design. The levels are always designs to give you lots of options, allowing you to tackle everything in the way that you want to. Usually you can hide under tables OR you can dive down from the roof-tops OR you can lure guars away with throwing bottles, OR you can avoid them altogether OR you can take the long way around.  Game also allows all the key people to be taken out via non-lethal means. Getting this wrong, was the main flaw with Deus Ex: Human Revoltuion. ...and these means are also very clever.    UNIMPRESSIVE STEALTH  This game makes a good attempt at stealth mechanics, but they remain just that: Mechanics. There is still plenty that stealth games can improve in terms of realism: - If you cross a backlit area, your silhouette won't get spotted. - The guards won't see you crossing an empty street from far away. - Guards won't get blinded (or even cover their eyes) by having spotlights shone into their eyes. - Guards won't feel a draft at their neck as you open two huge double doors behind them. - Some guards will pee every five minutes. - People won't care if you run around at a party with your weapons out, trampling all the rose bushes. - Hiding in/behind bushes doesn't work. - Guards just stand around forever until you trigger their scripted conversation. - Placing unconscious guards on top of weepers won't count at you killing them through plague infection. - You saving a woman (because it has to be a woman - feminism doesn't allow men in these sort of situations) carrying an improved strain of the plague, will count as a good thing instead of making you responsible for hundreds of more deaths. All these things make Dishonored 'just a game', with AI units patrolling along routes. Although these routes are fairly unpredictable (which is good) this would have been okay back in the Thief days, but today should set better standards for realism, than that.    DLC (THE KNIFE OF DUNWALL &amp; THE BRIGMORE WITCHES)  One thing should be made clear: The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches, are two halves of one game. Just buying one of them will only give you half a story. The Knife of Dunwall will give you some buildup, that it abruptly cut short, and The Brigmore Witches will continue from that point. When buying, make sure that both of these DLCs add up to a reasonable price for ONE normal length game. Sometimes you can get the GOTY edition of Dishonored for a cheaper price than these DLCs combined, and this edition will seamlessly integrate into Dishonored if you already have it.  This DLC does not feature Corvo as the main protagonist, but will to some degree tie into the original story. It features some changes and improvements of abilities, and the level design is richer too. However, the overarching main plot is slow-moving and almost non-existant, and you (and the character) is severely lacking in motivation.  The feminist undertones we saw in the original game, is now much more tolerable, only manifesting themselves in typical 'strong and capable woman' NPCs. ...not that I'd call any of them good role-models by any means.  I give the DLC the same score as Dishonored: 3 out of 5.",1,0

65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"After near 300 turns and hours of play, I must say this is a very nice twist on the 'Civ V hexbased franchise' (for lack of a better descriptor). It's not Alpha Centauri, but definitely just as fun. Plays very differently though, with the tech web being one of the major changes. The quest system is a great way to guide growth toward one of the victory conditions, and the culture/affinity system is of an interesting design but takes some getting used to. Small grievances towards feedback on some of the tooltips, e.g. not all effect of quest choices are explained in the tooltip when you have to choose.   All in all a cool experience, which I heartily recommend to any Civ fan. Definite 9/10.   I am very curious to any DLC this game may get in the future (if any).",1,0

251060,Wargame: Red Dragon,"This is one of the best RTS games ever made. I particualry like the way the single player campaigns are set up.   Great balance, with real 'cold war era' units. Units have very specific qualities to the vehicals, weapons, aircraft etc.  Combined operations and solid supply lines becomes quite key to victory. Suppression and cover are vital tactics. Speed Violence and Agression are key.  I have dumped hours into this game and although I do go and play other games, I find myself happily returning to this one on a regular basis.  Active developer adds maps and unit packs that most other developers would make one pay for as DLC, but Eugen systems gives for free.   Awesome multiplayer game with an active community.  There is a reason this game hasn't come down in price much, it is that good and yes it is worth it. If your a military RTS fan this one is a must have.  10/10  -Highside",1,0

286570,F1 2015,"i do not understand why everyone hates this game so much. For sure there are some bugs and the online part is very laggy but apart from that it is really good. The AI is the best i have ever seen in a racing game they divebomb you but they are still fair. The Handlingmodell is really good aswell in my opinion it is on par with the iRacing one in generall of course iRacing is a little bit more unforgiving but in terms of the actuall limit of the car f1 2015 is more realistic because I was faster in the iRacing Mclaren than i was in the f1 2015 one. I think if Codemasters improve the right things f1 2016 even gets close to the almighty rFactor2 which is probably the closest a game can get to real life prooven by the Formula 1 Teams who use the pro version of Rfactor2 for their simulators. In my opinion f1 2015 already beats iRacing and the very iRacing-ish Assetto Corsa although iRacing is used by a lot of professional drivers due to their huge community. F1 2015 is better because of some little things such as the unstability under breaking or the handling in the corners. As a guy who has driven a Formula Renault 2.0 car once i have to say the f1 2015 one is more challenging than the iRacing one. But again i have to say nothing gets even close to Rfactor2. My Ranking of the sims I have ever played ( in terms of realism and singleplayer) 1. Rfactor2- very realistic Handling, good and challenging AI, great price 2. F1 2015- quite realistic handling, very good and very challenging AI(the best out there),very good graphics( 2nd best to project cars) 3. Assetto Corsa- good handling but a bit to slippery and simple sometimes, at least some AI 4. iRacing-good but too slippery and simple handling, no AI but good community 5. Project Cars- too simple and grippy Handling, bad AI, bad community but good graphics- the letdown of the last 5 years",1,0

275610,,"One of those reviews where you are on the fence about recommending the game, gameplay itself is great it very diablo 3 like in its combat, if your a fan of the 40k universe you will love the weapon animations, its perk system is very simple but you unlock everything very fast, from health bonuses to weapon bonuses and extra grenade slots and the levels can be challenging at times. Survival mode is awesome, i will keep playing it for a long time to come.  There are quite a few downsides to the game, camera angles being the biggest for me, sometimes it outright makes the game unplayable, have screenshots to show how horrible they can be at times, the start up also has this weird green streaking which obviously will never be fixed and gives a poor introduction to the game, screenshots also provided, it feels kind of unfinished but i would say more unpolished, its the little details that where missed.   After 10 hours of gameplay im getting sick of the poor camera, lost oppotunity because there is a small selection of chapters to select from, would have been worthy dlc to add extra chapters or even chaos for the chaos fans out there. The game is really short and you should complete it within a few hours, dont pay full price for it, i would recommend it only on sale otherwise stay away until its on sale or they come back to this project and fix the random crashes, green screen and worse camera angles ive ever experienced in a game.",-1,0

It is by far the worst Tomb Raider game mechanically, it's full of bugs, the gameplay shows its age badly, and it's almost hostile to the player in how unfinished it seems. Yet, I keep finding myself drawn to it. Is it the overblown, almost Dan Brown-esque conspiracy storyline? Is it the almost exclusively modern European setting? Is it the fact that their are glimmers of amazing ideas in there (such as the RPG-esque levelling up system)? Well, yes, yes, and yes. If you read around AoD's production, not only do you get insight into CORE's struggles and the troubled development cycle, you also see hints of genuine passion and great ideas. And in the end, that is what I like about AoD, the unattainable. I wish I could experience their 'Lara in Arabia' concept, or see how Lara survived the end of TR4, I want to see the sequel set in the catacombs of Capadoceia, I want more Kurtis.

The plot is set with a different character and far from the old Altair and Ezio Auditore sequences of its original line-up crew. The story may be great, but maybe I really also enjoyed it because of the times we are fighting in (1750s-1780s American Revolution) and playing the unique Connor native american. Some complaints with the graphics would be the FPS drops in Boston and NY, but other than that I really have no complaints about it.

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"Not at all like the previous games in the series. It has 'Terrorist Hunt', but your map is chosen for you by game, and your outfittng (gun/armor choices) are limited to certain characters. You can't even customize the character. That was a reason I liked the last two games, Vegas 1 &amp; 2. Not a fan of multiplayer games, so I should have just ignored this one.  The destructible walls/floors/cielings are cool, but you can only shoot through some of it. A nice feature, but it doesn't make up for about 30% of the game they removed. The menus are very confusing to navigate, and it just feels like a ripoff going through the gun customizations and seeing all the 'in-game currency' requirements and purchaseable exp boosters. They're playing the microtransaction game too hard in an already starved for content game.  Don't buy.  Edit: Feb, 11 2016  I've come across a method for filtering out what map you want to play for Terrorist Hunt. It involves going to Options &gt; Matchmaking Preferences and then setting 'on' or 'off' for the maps you want or don't want the server to choose from. Extremely contrived and I hope they change it, but there you go. Map Selection.  Playing around with the different characters and guns still makes me yearn for the full armory available for each character, but Ubisoft is still clinging to 'PVP balancing'. As a purely PVE player, I could care less.  After getting used to the quirks, I'd raise my grade for the game up from a D to a C-, but I still don't reccommend it.

Initially, I was disappointed, as I wanted a new version to Civ V, but now that I have spent more time with it, I can see that most of the changes were a good thing. Almost every part of the game has been revamped. Land utilization is paramount as districts provide valuable bonuses, but farms and mines are necessary for growth, and wonders essential for cultural and diplomatic growth. The AI is still dumb, unfortunately. In this installment it shows in surprise war declarations that bring no actual assaults, denouncements for silly things, and them asking for free stuff constantly.

214770,Guacamelee! Gold Edition,"There's a lot more to wish from indy hit  Guacamelee  but one thing the game does right, one thing from which all other game companies should learn, one thing so important that it got me to start writing video game reviews on a hopefully weekly basis, and that's GAME DIFFICULTY.  Game Difficulty is not an excuse to make players redo the whole stage over and over again because you missed a jump. 'Difficult' is not adding HP or extra damage to monsters. I swear there are still too many punishing mechanics masked as challenge curves such as forcing the player to wait or rushing to reclaim everything that you've earned in a previous playthrough. 'Difficult' makes the player think and plan. 'Difficult' should challenge the game developer as much as it challenges the player.   Guacamelee  is difficult, especially if you want the true ending, but it's not punishing. I miss a jump, I go back to the last platform, I try again. THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD BE. THIS IS WHAT EARNS THIS GAME THE THUMBS UP FROM THIS REVIEWER. I never felt like I was wasting any time playing Guacamelee. There's variety in the platforming challenges, introduced by incorporating the special moves that you discover as tools to broaden movement. The Rooster Uppercut introduces double, then triple jumps. The Dashing Derpderp (bad name, I know), brings a horizontal dash and so forth... There's no resource management to worry about (and that's including health management), you just have the platform challenge in its purest form.  I'm old. Thirty-five years old. I've played the old NES platformers.  There is absolutely nothing good to remember from any of these games.  None. I'm gushing because I remember ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Castlevania, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ninja Turtles and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Megaman and  Guacamalee  ISN'T LIKE THAT. Thank goodness. By the way, that's why every review of Shovel Knight has made me wary of it. Briefly considered it, considered the hype, remembered the old days and went NUH-UH.  Ironically, the hard mode of this game is a complete wash. Just more damage from the monsters and more hits required to kill 'em. Kinda breaks the whole point of my review but I really wanted to laud everything else about this game.  It really does seem like a fun challenging platformer with monsters thrown in because of course you need monsters to smash. A whole combo tutorial camp and none of its lessons are ever necessary. A game built around luchadors and then you have this weak ♥♥♥ combat system. It's kind of a bait-and-switch in that regard: the moves you unlock seem to have a platforming purpose first and an enemy bashing purpose second... Artificial purpose at that, what with the introduction of colored shields to force you to use the appropriately colored attack. That's a juvenile way to handle combat. Boss fights centered on pattern recognition? Yes, that is a hallmark from the platformers of old but that doesn't mean you couldn't add some innovation on it.  I ain't mad, and this is coming from a huge wrestling fan who bought the game because he wanted to play a luchador protagonist. The rest of the game made it worth it.",1,0

214950,Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition,"Well where to start, I have been a fan op the entire TW franchise since Shogun 1 came out! so Rome 2 needed to be in my posession as fast as possible. It's true you'll find a lot of negative reviews on here because Creative assembly has the nasty habit of releasing the games full of bugs, but they also have the great habit of eliminating those bugs bit by bit and ending up with awesome, wellbalanced games.  The standard title takes you back to the early days of the roman empire and gives you the choice of managing certain factions; Rome being one of them ofc. You are basically the emperor in charge of everything from foodsupply, religion, taxing, esionage and military command.  Theres two major parts in the game; The campaignmap lets you see 'the big picture' manage your cities, move your armies, spies and other subterfuge around. When two enemy armies meet or you are sieging a city or fortyou go to the second part op the game, the battlemap. On the battlemap you commat the armies you created, make the cavalry charge but watch out for spears! make the swordsmen hit the flank! its all up to you! you control every little aspect of the battle!

417860,Emily is Away,"Basically, if you want to simulate your teen years trying to suck up to a &lt;female dog&gt; that puts you on an emotional rollercoaster, then play this game. I understand it could be considered a reflection of a real life story, but this is a story with no real...resolution. Is the resolution is to somehow stop yourself from being conned into these waste-of-time relationships? But you would never know it hurt until you got into one yourself and had some great experiences. So should you avoid all relationships altogether to completely eliminate that chance? Not quite...  ...I think it more or less shatters the expectation that the one you think will be with you forever is meant to be with you. There is no ONE person, and statistically there are probably several different viable candidates (even based on your picky 'ol criteria!). I mean look at the side character Emma or whoever it is you end up hanging out with at college. What the &lt;H-E -Double Hockey Sticks&gt; was wrong with her? Did she die? Seems like you had buttloads of fun with her!  Maybe when I have gone through the thick of these teen/young adult years I will come out with a better resolution, but perhaps this is what the author meant:   It is best that you go away sometimes  , that you set the pace for your life and that emotional attachments, like most other things, can be transient in this world. But don't let this get you down, it may be worth it to love after all, and we are social creatures. I wish you the best of luck with this.  4.5/5 Heart Containers",1,1

450220,Overload Playable Teaser,"Descent didn't really hit my thoughts at the beginning when I played this game, until I've read other reviews about this game then it started to click. Also from reading the description of the game too, they stated that it was from the creators of Descent (I should start reading that). Besides that anyway, the game looks really good especially if you're someone who missed the old Descent days and just want to dive into that sea of nostalgia. Sadly this was probably a time that I was still way too young to know about video games like this so I'll just leave the rest for veteran players to review that part. As a new player, it was a pretty simple and fun game but I wish they added something with a more modern content into it. It's still a alpha/beta build anyways so they might add a little bit more here and there.  Don't let it sway you from playing this game though, this game is pretty fun at it's current state if you want to pass the time and cry a little inside whenever you get shot down by the robot that's been strafing left and right which you can't seem to hit for some reason #me  But anyways, for anyone who would like to check our gameplay of it out, we invite you to this link:   https://youtu.be/6B0le-E0uXU ",1,0

291010,The Hat Man: Shadow Ward,"At first the game lures you in with a scary atmosphere, and gives you a simple goal to find some pages, and a random ghost for some reason. And for a while, the only thing to scare you is your imagination as you go through a literal endless 1st level that's extremely hard to find anything in, but after a while you learn that this game isn't going to abuse you, it's going to take things slow, maybe a little too slow for a horror game, but then on the second level, it starts getting a little scarier with better ambience, Hatman gets faster and goes through walls for some great jumpscares, as well as an even creepier atmosphere and a little more progress through the story, though not much. Even so, it's a pretty well made game and I'm so excited that the official release finally came. However, there are still some issues that I don't quite like.. Not too big but issues: TOO BIG! Holy crap finding your way through this place and collecting items is harder than a dark souls boss, and progression through 1 level can take maybe an hour if you're not familiar with the game, and seeing the same thing over and over again isn't fun. The second issue is that Hatman only gets harder through levels and not time. I should know, because I'm one of the people who spent an hour on the first level. As you're looking through the first floor frantically looking for missing pages, or an item you may have missed, you get lost easily and well.. It stops being fun. Mostly because Hatman is like a companion you can kill but respawns.. Kind of like Tails in the sonic franchise, he never dies and he will come back later but.. You can kill him again easily. The problem with this is like a battle in skyrim against a townie who can't die, you can hit him over and over and over and over again but he won't go down for good, and the battle is infinite because you can't die to him either. The only option is to step outside and face the guards waiting for you,,,, though in this game that's more like the only option is to keep searching for items.. But other than ALL of that, great game!",1,0

230410,Warframe,"I LOVE Warframe, i've spent hours on it, but I to be honest it has some pretty bad issues (that eventually) led to me slowly stop playing the game. For starters, i'm probably not the only one, but connectivity and playing with friends takes FOREVER, like the loading screen for a mission. You can stay there for 30+ min (I have experienced this many times). Also, the lag in the game. I know Warframe is beautiful in graphics but even with a nice computer and all the settings on low, I still freeze, and see flying kubrows, enemies, etc.Sadly that is not the only problem. The fact that after awhile, shooting the same enemies and listening to the same dialouge is a bit disappointing and dull after doing basically everything. I enjoy the fact that they keep updating the game, but how about new enemies? A new race of enemies? Games like LoL, Dota2, Terraria, Minecraft (In my opinion) have the replayability that many games I look for don't have. How? Even though each game is 'the same' its not. For instace LoL, Dota2, you will never fight the same enemies and each game will be different, and with new content, its always interesting. Minecraft and Terraria, a lot of playability, building infinite amount of creations, lots of content, etc. Now Warframe however, sure has nice playability in the start. The missions at first are cool and exciting. But when you go to those same maps over and over, shooting the same people over and over for the same type of missions. Yeah, not very exciting anymore. So when I see new missions (like Mirage's missions) I go crazy. If only there were more variety, more variables in the game. Mobas have many combinations of team comps. And each game has other players, so different playstyles and skill levels, so the game will never be the same even though it is.Now I do compare Warframe to other games, but how can you talk about a game you once play that you don't? And the other games offer the things I, and other players want that Warframe either doesn't offer at the moment, or perhaps doesn't do the best at.",1,0

Then when it came out it started getting good reviews and good internet buzz and I thought, 'Well, a lot of bad games get good reviews and have people defending it online. It's probably just unfounded hype.'  Then the free weekend for PC rolled along and I was like 'Alright fine, I'll try the game!' So I hustled myself a code online and by the end of the weekend I had had so much fun playing I couldn't wait a couple of days for it to drop in price during the Steam sale. I had to have it at once so I could keep playing.   Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a joyfully addictive FPS with strategic gameplay and a highly skill-based difficulty curve will definitively make it my go to FPS in 2016.",1,0

The story is engaging as it ever was and the characters are colorful, well developed and nicely voiced, with some surprising appearances along the way. The puzzles are well balanced and satisfying to solve without being too difficult or really obvious. If you get stuck in any puzzle the hint system is really helpful and well designed, gradually revealing the answers to the puzzles so you can figure it out for yourself and won't need a walkthrough if you get stuck in the game.

367580,Hook,"WIth a price like this, especially on sale, you're either a complete Scrooge or your wallet is totally dead from all the other things to pass up a little gem like this. Frankly, I don't know why there are negative reviews at all, considering how cheap this is. Are you really gonna find a game better than this for the amount you're paying? Hook is surprisingly complex for a minimalistic game, and while no level is impossible, it takes a few tries and you'll always hear that satisfying 'click' as the last lock unravels at the end of a level. Difficulty wise, again the curve is fairly maneagable as the game slowly introduces more complex mechanics over the 50 levels, and the introduction of the 'three strikes/lives' is a nice help later in the game where it gets to the point where it's almost impossible not to make a mistake. Length wise, it took me about 45 minutes to finish, no walkthrough required, but I was getting into a rhythm and just steam-rolling through at times. It really depends on your approach to solving these puzzles. Some find it fun to do it completely in their heads, others might trace the wires around. The ambience is really nice and I found myself getting into the zone, where despite the sheer amount of different 'locks', it was still possible to figure out which line lead to where without too much effort, and the super minimalist design does Hook justice here.

When this appeared during the holiday sale, I decided I ought to have it on a current device and snatched it up. The game and story are still every bit as engrossing as I remember them, but I find the lack of controller support to be super-annoying. Furthermore, perhaps it is just my laptop, but graphical issues abound. I can't Alt-Tab without the program crashing (which means that any time I adjust the volume it crashes); it also crashes frequently during cutscenes. I am sure I could rectify some of these issues with some internet research and some editing of the .ini file, but I don't think I should HAVE to do that.

324260,VoidExpanse,"Void Expanse is what I've been looking for in a space game. I'm so tired of seeing Medieval Action-RPG games. It's about time a space Action-RPG game is made that I can enjoy. I've searched for space games and I kept coming across nothing but RTS space games. Void Expanse is very similar to Drox Operative but it is so much better, IMO. I can choose what I want to do, whether it is mining for a little while to get cash, or deciding to test my new ship, weapons, devices, etc., or do co-op missions with friends. It is very fun and keeps me occupied for hours. If I choose, I can host my own dedicated server and have friends join in on the fun. Single player characters can be used in Multiplayer games as well. So a Single player character can be built up and continue to be built up in Multiplayer, back and forth. Very fun game! I highly recommend it.",1,0

What redeeming factor does this greedy, greedy game have? let's see...  1.) It looks nice. Runs okay. Wouldn't say that it was great. SC: Chaos Theory looked marvelous. And ran like a dream. 2.) Hunting is very...Eh..Logical? I can't find a word for it. It feels very real, like an actual hunt. Where every shot HAD to count. And every shot HAD to be accurate. Or else, you are left with nothing. 3.) Uh...Tsk tsk tsk...What else. What else...Erm...Walking? It has walking. I guess. The thing that you will mostly be doing.  Thats...All I could find redeeming about this game. And they still couldn't really help. This should be illegal to put a 'FREE TO PLAY' sticker on it.

33230,Assassin's Creed II,"I currently haven't played the PC version of the game but I am trying my best to play it now. The only problems are that it takes forever to install (but yet again that goes for ALL big games, so I guess you shouldn't take that to heart), and after that I put my earphones in and thought 'Hey I can play this game finally!' only to have that lovely prospect put under my nose before being thrown to David Cameron's prize piggy, Skyrim was a large game but it didn't require all the different installs and patches this thing needed. If you've finished the first installation be aware you have another hour left. If you were prepared for this it wouldn't be that much of a biggy but I was given no prior warning to this and so it's like going into a cinema and having the opening for the movie played every now and then but then it cuts to a massive string of adverts. When I finally got to the Uplay section and made an account I thought I got to play. Not very likely! The game simply froze and told me it had stopped working. I then tried to start the game up again but the same thing happened. And again. This process happened numerous times.  Now I have yet to actually play the game, but while playing it on PS3 I would say it is a very good game, lots of funny stuff in it and it's all very nice when you get to stab someone. But be aware getting INTO the game may take a longer time than it would take to actually get through the whole thing.

99810,Bulletstorm,"Forget the laws of physics.  ok, initially I was reserved about this game, but tall my doubts have been dispelled.   Before I start, I'd like to say 'yes', it is possible to disable those annoying points popping up whenever you kill someone in an ingenious ways. Perhaps, there are a few who care about that, but I was constantly afraid that those points would mar the gameplay for me and ruin the immersion - which is sorta what happened with Borderlands. There is no way to disable the crosshair though.  Anyways, you play as vigilante turned space pirate. Well, it's a bit more complicated than that but they explain the reasons in the first 15 minutes of the game. Your character kinda looks like a raptor only with hair but at the same time he has a voice and personality, which is always welcome in shooters. Still, you have no body and cast no shadow so still you are, for the most part, just a couple of arms floating around. Maybe I should spend the next 5 years of my life studying programing and video game designing so I could get a job with some gaming company and be in charge of creating legs and shadow for the character you play in a shooter. You do get to see your legs when you slide though; So annoying...  The game is using Unreal Engine 3 which is considered outdated by many, even though it does the dynamic lightening thing, it's seems a bit too stale, the fire looks really outdated, the textures look like they are stacked on top of each other, plus I'd say that the physics need a little work. They used the same engine for Gears of War 2 as well the Singularity game, which wasn't for my liking to say the least. Even the electric leash you use in the game is sorta reminiscent of the hacking tool in Bionic Commando as well as the device you were wearing in Singularity. What's annoying though is that even if you disable auto-aim and aim assist, the leash would still auto-aim for you and pull your screen in the direction of the object being pulled. Both Singularity and Bulletstorm implement the slow mo sniper bullet time wherein you can actually guide your bullet towards the enemy.  Also, what I found unsettling is that you can use your leash infinitely. You can actually beat a large chunk of the game (minus the bosses) by using your leash and kicking enemies until they are dead.  You can also dash and slide for a long time. Like, REALLY long time. You don't get to slide on the floor as far as you can in Vanquish, however you are still able to slide for an unnaturally long time on rough surfaces and shoot at enemies, somehow. You actually move faster in the game by sliding all the time instead of running, which makes little sense. But that makes it harder for enemies to hit you and for you too hit them since you are sliding too fast; and there is no stamina bar. Hell, you can even slide uphill if that fits your fancy.  The kick. Well, yeah, the kicking ability really does augment the gameplay. But I wouldn't want people to consider this kicking ability to be something special and innovative, since I would like that credit to go to The Dark Messiah game which I am pretty sure was the first one to implement the kicking ability which always came in handy in kicking enemies off the cliffs and even in melee fights.   In the trailer you can see the enemy growling in agonizing pain after you shot him in his groin equipment. However, on hard mode, after growling for a few seconds, your enemy will recover, deal with the loss of the important male body part and then keep on shooting at you.  Blood. Yes, there is plenty of blood leaking and bursting out of your enemies. And there's plenty of gore and decapitations in general. You will get to see some loose limbs lying around. It did get under my skin to see those giant plants eating the savages though.  Cursing, yes, there's plenty of that too.  There are no free weapons in the game. You earn new weapons by getting skill shots. You also get to upgrade them so there is incentive to kill enemies in different ways - just as advertised.  The enemies look nice. They look a bit too buff and too clean though for a wasted planet.  One major flaw of the game is that if you outrun your enemies, that is if you outslide them and choose to slide past towards your objective and venture too far then you will die. Supposedly, you get shot in the back which is what one of the loading screen tells you. So I guess that is how they fixed the problem of rushing in this game, well maybe they should made the game slightly more challenging and took away the infinite sliding ability.   The sidekick in the game is also quite interesting and intriguing. While the character you play is a hairy and smelly loud mouthed ego-maniacal raptor, your juxtaposed sidekick is quite different. His cold calculated decisions and logical unbiased thinking reminded me of Spock, I think that was a nice touch. It is fun seeing the two battle out the the classic fate vs. coincidence moments.  I'm not going to say that the general gameplay of this game is flawless and that everyone will like it, but the pacing of the game is good and it will let you kill some time. The game reminded me of Borderlands on some occasions. You get see the giant skeletons of prehistorical creatures, just like in Borderlands.The AI is okay. The enemies rush, shoot, take cover, melee.  On the general positive note, the game has plenty of funny moments that are guaranteed to put a smirk on your face. Even when you can think of every possible classy quote, chances are, it's already been used and has become a cliche somewhat. However, this game does squeeze out quite a many memorable quotes that you probably didn't hear before. Some things are pretty innovative, especially the amusement park and some escape levels.There is never a dull moment and there are some memorable battle and escape sets and despite the strict linear gameplay, I still had fun feeling like an unstoppable killing machine in the world that makes little sense.  Regardless, I felt the need to pick the game to pieces and poke fun at its inconsistencies and complete disregard for the laws of physics, but I nevertheless had a good time playing it, and I still do. It's highly probably you will beat the game twice.  P.S. The last two words in the game made my day.",1,0

It looked pretty interesting, so I threw down my $4.99 and loaded it up; a few minutes in, I was hooked.  I'm very bad at writing actual words so I'm going to resort to a pros/cons list.  Pros:   A very cool concept, presented well.   Contains very cool commentary regarding player/developer relations.   Lots to explore and discover. I definitely didn't see everything my first playthrough.   Puzzles and challenges simple enough to avoid frustration, yet difficult enough to feel rewarding.   Music is alright, not the best but still good.   Probably one of the coolest bosses I've seen in a while.   Cons:   Very short. Not necessarily a con, but worth mentioning.   Jumping portions were tedious.   Graphics were neat, but gave me a headache.   Some bosses were very boring.   All in all, a very cool game that is absolutely worth 5 bucks. Give it a shot!",1,0

245280,ENSLAVED™: Odyssey to the West™ Premium Edition,"Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is the 2010 action-adventure game developed by Ninja Theory (noted for Heavenly Sword and infamous for DmC: Devil May Cry) and published by Namco Bandai, recently re-released for the PC with all the DLC included.   Important to note: use a gamepad. Most are compatible with PC and easy to set up, it's a worthwhile investment, especially for games like these.  The majority of the time spent ingame is on a functional if barebones hack n slash combat system and 'Uncharted-like' platforming system.   Combat itself is very responsive - the counter will always work, the evade has a nice amount of i-frames, and you never feel like you're working against the game, just with it. It is, predictably, marred heavily by its sheer lack of variation - you will be working with the same moves from beginning to end, bar a few bought 'enhancements' that won't affect your actual combos, and enemy variation caps out at 4 with three minibosses.   Combined with the platforming that's completely braindead and nigh automated, and while the game never gets boring it's never in danger of challenging you or demanding anything resembling skill, even starting on Hard. The upgrade system ingame exacerbates this, simply making an already easy affair easier.  Despite the odd novelty shooting segment or 'Cloud' platforming section, where you impersonate Tony Hawk in a post-apocalyptic setting (the most fun sections of the game), and the aforementioned minibosses, the game never has any 'real' boss battles or sense of climactic moments. The game eventually blends into a continuous slurry, pacing-wise.  A gorgeous slurry at that. Every single environment in Enslaved is eye-candy, with even the more robotic-leaning levels managing to impress and becoming absolutely stunning during the Village levels. Animations are fluid and the camera supports it, with the game taking advantage of its limits. While the story goes from interesting to dull to absolutely stupid, the voice-acting throughout all of it is top-notch.  Worth mentioning is that the included DLC, 'Pigsy's Perfect 10', is more than just weirdly good: it's almost as fun as the base game, a 3-hour or so romp playing as 'Pigsy' with four gadgets, an unlimited amount of bullets, and more stealth-oriented gameplay. You can access it in 'Extras', which is a bit out-of-the-way.  Unfortunately the OST - outside of the DLC's banjo-infested romps which never fail to get old - is boring orchestrated filler and completely forgettable, with a lot of seeming SFX issues on top of it; actions triggering with no sound attached. The game as a whole is almost hilariously glitchy - nothing game-breaking, but I've had to restart at Checkpoints several times with Trip falling through the game world or Monkey doing the monkey dance midair. Forever.  Enslaved, at its best, plays like the likes of 'Jak and Daxter' with fast-paced combat and platforming, and at its worst, plays like a dry, dull AAA affair with railroaded platforming, forced cover-based shooting segments and blatant technological problems. Ultimately, it's worth playing and then some, but not without keeping the caveats in mind.  It's not a game you should be buying for the mechanics, but to look at idly while you skim through it once then forget about it. It doesn't have the depth or the variety to support multiple playthroughs and ultimately ends up a bit of a chore (take it from me). Absolutely no incentive to 100% it either, not so much as a congratulations message. Still a bit sore about that.  Keep it in mind when you see it in a sale, is what Enslaved: Odyssey to the West deserves. It deserves something.",1,0

394230,Battleborn,"I can't give this game enough praise. It is everything I was hoping for and more. This game has kept me laughing the entire time but what do I really like about the game?.....  The strategy aspect. This is not your typical shootem up Call of Duty clone. This game takes real strategy without just rushing into the enemy team looking for kills. I've been on teams that had twice the number of kills as the enemy team yet we still lost because they worked together to complete the objective.   Between the talent trees and gear, each character feels completely unique. The games are fast paced and full of action. In fact there is so much going on that it is overwhelming for the first few hours of play. I just didn't understand this by watching Twitch channels and Youtube videos. This game has depth and requires investment if you want to have success.  The only downside is the lack of players PC side. I've heard the console version is doing just fine but the que times for Meltdown can be quite lengthy. Unfortunately that is my favorite game mode. I'm still holding out though.

390290,Bulb Boy,"Ever wondered about Tim Burton making games on crack? No? But if you want to see what could happen in such combination, please buy 'Bulb Boy', it will probably ruin your 'sweet dreams'. Don't get me wrong, it isn't 'scary' game, it's just sick fairy tale about Bulb Boy, who is fighting his own anxiety and nightmares.   When you was small, you probably saw something innocuous, but during dreams the same 'innocent' thing appeared in twisted, horrifying way. This is what 'Bulb Boy' is about - fighting child's inner fears about every-day reality and about happiness and cohesion of a family.   Anyways, 'Bulb Boy' is a rich source of messages for every headshrinker:-D  Be aware, this game isn't standard point'n'click adventure. Certainly, there is objects combing and normal inventory, but the tasks are very simple and there's a lot of arcade elements. It's just casual game, where you want to see some abominable, nasty, gross, but funny things, but not really tricky puzzles, or riddles.   Check this game out, if you want to see some disturbing, but good graphics, working mechanis, and black, twisted humor. Avoid it when you're looking for a top notch, classic adventure game in Gabriel Nigt, or Monkey Island style.  Nevertheless, Tim Burton should be proud:-)   PS. This game has a one, but significant flaw, it's too short.",1,0

391730,Crashlands,"Just manage to finish this game. I think it is more suitable to people who have too many time in their hands. There isn't a leveling system. It feels like a single player mmorpg whereby you need to hit damn a lot of monster and same monster just to farm to the next level of workshop. It is easy to craft certain item but it is also very hard to find those rare material for faming. Do not be despair whereby certain item is totally optional. I never get a single hair louse at all even though I finish the game. Also, try not to overfarm certain item, just get enough of it should be fine. There is more than 300 items in the game. Fastest way to win this game is to...   1) Learn not to get hit at all. They practically 1 hit KO you if you don't have full set of armor, but the dodging is easy once you have 100% damage range weapon or more stun. Try get those eventually. There is a lot of different type. 2) Aim for the next workshop/upgrade. 3) All armor is optional once you learn (1). Just focus on weapon. I skipped a lot of armor building since it is a hassle to find those ingredient. 4) MIssion is important, even it looks optional because certain recipe only can get from the quest. There are two quest I remember mission stucked is the Nitro(1st map) and the Thrombopump(3rd map) because I thought those are optional quest. So I ended up running around the map for no good reason thinking that the recipe will drop. It won't...  I really like the pet system. It is so damn strong...",1,0

219890,Antichamber,"'Mind-bending' is less a description of Antichamber and more a hint for solving its puzzles. The game clearly has its own consistent internal logic and random things don't just occur to mess with the player's head. However, many of Antichamber's puzzles depend on upsetting the usual order of things to - if the tablets of advice hidden around the game are to be believed - teach a lesson about life. It is not terribly uncommon, for example, to turn around and find yourself in a different place than where you came from. It makes no logical sense, but over time, it becomes a reasonable solution. While still sporting more straightforward puzzles like covering a series of sensors with a limited number of blocks, Antichamber seems to more often beg the player to look at the problem sideways. Instead of looking for tools to get around obstacles, understand that every situation may not operate under the same set of rules. Be willing to adjust assumptions based on new observations. But these observations need to be made independently by the player as the game itself provides no real external assistance; even the ultimate purpose of the game isn't handed to the player. Without guidance, you're left to discover your own meaning to the strange and sometimes inconsistent world around you - just as everyone must do as they progress through life.",1,1

447530,VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action,"This is a bit of a strange one. It's more or less a visual novel with mini games, but its suprisingly well written and engrossing. Has a bit of an emotional hit, but is also consistently hillarious.  The main mechanic of the game is mixing drinks (this is pretty simple, drag and drop). Characters behave differently based on what drinks you give them. The game basically always gives you something to do to break up the reading, even in the one or two scenes away from the bar.  I only got one ending (the 'good' ending) and I can't say I'm particularly compelled to play the game again to get more (it took about 10 hours to complete from start to finish and I'm a fast reader). The bartending mechanic probably helps, but maybe give a miss if you can't stand visual novels. But otherwise, I would definitely recommend a go through.  Some good points:  - Relatively well written - Consistently pretty funny - Suprisingly unique art style - Creative setting and environment - Engaging and engrossing - Pretty good soundtrack  Some bad points:  - Maybe a few too many Reddit memes - Story and setting is so open ended it's difficult for it to reach a satisfying conclusion. - Game is bad at providing feedback when one of your decisions has changed the story (this is important in making you feel like an active participant in the story, imo)",1,0

So my first impressions of the game are good, in terms of gameplay the sounds are immaculate and very realistic. The force feedback you recieve through the wheel are really good and racing is challenging especially in multiplayer.  Pros:  -Great Sounds -Great Force Feedback -Car models look good -Racing is a challenge and you feel like you are in a real car -Has support for all controllers (wheels and joysticks and controllers) -You can make your own overlay for a race and broadcast it live -If you drive the wrong way you ghost meaning that trolls cannot crash you out using a head on collision -Physics and handling are very realistic -Different modes: Novice, Amateur and Realistic -Decent Graphics and fps with support for high end and low end spec computers -Good default overlay -So many things that can be changed in settings  Cons:  -The free mode only comes with 3 (I think) car series and 2 (I think) tracks -No pit crew/garage interior -No Career mode where you can make your own racer and have any sort of car improvement -Mirror visibility is not great and hard to depict cars until they are too close to try and defend  I realise this game is still in development and i am looking forward to more content but I think sector3 studios have done a fantastic job on this game so its a thumbs up from me.  Therefore I would rate it 9/10 as there could be a few things that could be improved (like adding some more free dlc etc.) but it surprised me with how good the gameplay was.",1,0

217270,Karateka ,"Karateka is a pretty straightforward game, literally. You move one of three characters forward while fighting off guards and bosses. The fights are rhythm based and give you an indication of when to block and when to attack. It's a fun idea, unless you want to listen to some background music of course. You start off with the True Love. The idea is to finish the game with this character in order to get the true ending. If this character is defeated in battle, he'll be replaced by a new characters which also gives you a different ending. It's unlikely you'll finish your first game with the first character, because the battles increase in difficulty near the middle of the game, which is about 15 minutes in. That's right. The game only lasts 30 minutes per session.  The graphics are cartoony and look pretty good in motion. The movies, however, look, and probably are, compressed. The sounds are nothing to write home about, but they get the job done. Would I recommend it ? In a way, yes, because the character idea is fresh and it's fun while it lasts. But the current price is just to steep if you ask me, especially for a game this short (even though it requires multiple playthroughs). Wait for a pricedrop; then get it.  [Rating: 77/100]",1,0

I originally noticed Rocket League when I attended the convention RTX in Austin, Texas and watched Freddie Wong kick the butt of fellow players 2 on 1 as well as inviting members of the public to hop onto teams and join in. A game that anyone can just pick up and play is a wonderful idea and I haven't found a game like this in a long time.  Considering my internet connection is nothing but useless I also have to express my gratitude that the single player activites are very entertaining. Yes NPCs seem to get a kick out of scoring own goals or nudging the opposing players passes into your goal (even on the hardest difficulty) but the tournement style gameplay still made me want to score and win, or at least come away without the match ending in 0-N. Practice mode is also intresting, if annoying as trying to stay air born while being a car is a tricky thing to accomplish.

Imagine if Geometry, by the same token, wished to learn about us humans, diverse and seemingly upredictable as we are. This game is that journey. Whereas we experimented with fragments of Geometry, like triangles, like circles, Geometry experiments of our species, like you, like me. When we conjectured rules about Geometry, we drew a picture, did some math, and tested it's consistency. When Geometry conjectures rules about humanity, it crafts a puzzle, does some math, and tests your consistency. Over time, using these experiments, we were able to prove many things about the Truths of Geometry, given some basic assumptions. Brainbending, and seemingly always to have some kind of overarching moral statement that is forever just beyond one's grasp, I am left wondering what it was that Geometry was proving about Humanity with this game, or what were it's basic assupions about us.",1,0

239350,Spelunky,"Spelunky is one of the best games I have ever played. It solves very well many of the troubles that are present in traditional platformers, while conserving the fast pace of gameplay and adding more interesting decisions. Because of its random generation, the game will never force you or even give you the option to replay levels that you have already played, meaning that it is a new and fresh experience each time, and it actually tests your ability to platform rather than how well you have memorized its levels. The controls are very tight, and the random generation is one of the most fair that I have ever seen; rarely will you get a level that is significantly more or less difficult than average. Also notable is that the average run length is very very low, maybe 1-5 minutes for a new player, since you will be dying a lot. A successful run (don't expect this at first) will take close to 20.  The game does have its flaws: personally I find the game significantly more difficult when playing with keyboard controls, and because the character jumps very low to the ground but runs very fast it plays significantly different from most platformers (you'll get used to this, don't worry). By far the biggest flaw is its difficulty curve. The first several runs where you make it to a new area will basically be 'oh, that kills you?' and you unexpectedly and hilariously die. At the end of the difficulty curve comes the endgame of score running and speed running and challenge running and things... I did these things because there were acheivements for them (like 200 hours into the game btw), and while I definitely enjoyed getting those acheivements, if you're actually trying to top (any of the) leaderboards or do some of the most difficult challenge runs (eggplant run) the game basically comes down to reseting for a good seed and taking every risk. But that's all strictly optional, and at least for me the option came after a few hundred hours of enjoyment.  Though I've thought a lot about the game's flaws, I love it. I spend a lot of time replaying the game and keeping my skills sharp, even if I'm focussing on some other game at the time. I strongly recommend this game.",1,0

There was one puzzle that I had to look up how to solve, (this seems to be a common issue) but the rest I solved before even getting their clues. I would find items that were completely useless for me. I kept expecting to leave the house after fixing it up, but the game just... ended.  Right now as it is I can't recommend it. I feel like it's definitely unfinished storywise and the difficulty is baffling to me. If it at least had steam trading cards I could say, 'play it if you get it in a bundle' but as it is, I can't even say that. I'd say just look at the pictures or watch the trailer because you'll get all the charm of the art, but none of the disappointment of the actual game.  Note: I am NOT one of the people who criticize this game for its length. I love Hamlet (also on steam) and it's only thirty minutes long. What bothers me is that it feels incomplete and the puzzles weren't fun to me.",-1,0

313080,The Masterplan,"Within 30 seconds of starting this game a massive graphical glitch occured which put letters and symbols all over the tutorial screen. I tried this level multiple times and it happened everytime. It doesn't end there though. Grapical glitches occur regularly throughout gameplay causing objects such as doors to be textured incorrectly or flat out invisible. I tried to look into the options menu to see if there was any settings I could try chaning to fix this issue. Turns out there isn't an options menu, you can toggle fullscreen on and off, you can toggle music on and off, and you can see what the controls are, you can't even rebind the controls if you don't like the defaults. You can't change the resolution or anything that is expected of a modern day PC videogame. These issues and lack of features became very distracting and rendered the game unejoyable. TL;DR This game should still be in early access in its current state.",-1,0

Honestly, my first red flag should've been when the game told me you could only gain a certain amount of experience/keys a day through solo play, but I guess developers have to keep the online alive somehow, even if it's not the best way to do so.  However, the real problems started showing when we started playing and realized the changes made that honestly felt like Turtle Rock knows nothing about proper balance, even with a game like this. Depending on who you're with or up against, it's either a win with no way for the monster to fight back, or the monster clears out the entire team before even getting half way to stage two. Not to mention there are certain hunters that feel like they were made without even thinking of how OP they could be (like Maggie being able to track the monster's every move, Val being able to revive fallen hunters from afar with her medi-ray, Hank being able to give every hunter so much armor the monster can't punch through it before he gives it right back, etc).  We were hoping to have a good time hunting each other, but it just turned out to be more frustrating than it should have been.",-1,0

394450,,"As someone who played through and enjoyed the mobile iOS game all the way through the first two difficulty levels and mostly through the last, I'm disappointed by this port. It feels incomplete in some sense, and almost lazy.   For those not in the know, in the mobile version, kit/unit expansion was done through requisition purchases and in-app purchases (hereforth to be referred to as IAP), to buy cards packs. These packs allow for you to get 3 cards, one marine and 2 items (with the chance for rare/epic cards). This system made sense with IAP being a potential option for people who don't have the time to endlessly grind levels and get a chance at getting better marines or gear.   I agree with the exclusion of in-app purchases, let me say that right here. But without them, the way forward is unfortunately set to be a grindfest, with a pack at the end of every chapter. Let's be honest, systems like these - with randomized rewards in a boosterpack like purchase are designed to encourage people to spend real-world money over and over on cards/items they don't need for the chance of getting something they want. That's how it works with trading card games, that's how it works in mobile apps. This system does not make sense in a premium game with no IAP, and as such should have been replaced with something else more fitting.   Maybe non-randomised cards. Gain more requisition per level like gold, buy a marine for X requisition, buy gear for X requisition. Spend requisition on your existing gear to upgrade gear. Meanwhile get exp on missions, level up and advance your marine. And when your marine is capped, spend requisition to advance him to the next tier. That's an example off the top of my head, and most likely would have been tweakable for a much better system than the one currently in place. As it stands you get a small amount of req per level, can purchase tiny 3 card packs, and maybe trade in unused marines and items for small amounts of req, making obtaining better marines and gear a grindfest. Not of the pleasurable kind.   Furthermore, the 3 Enhanced Edition chapters are not complete, and do not progress past tier 2, while the other 3 go to tier 4. Also, the graphics aren't even visibly that much better and there is still no multiplayer.  TLDR: feels lazy, exp/buying marine system broken, incomplete bonus chapter rosters, still no multiplayer. If you really liked the mobile one and want to grind your way through the game on PC go for it i guess...",-1,1

236390,War Thunder,"The potential for the game is here. With the most aircraft available of any flying sim ever, and the devs 'trying' to make it as close to real life as possible, it's definitly worth checking out. There's also a tank mode, worth checking out for the novelty, but it will get bland fast due to this mode not being finished yet.  THE PROS: Loads of airplanes with each their own flight model to try out, there's planes for the USA, Germany, Soviet Russia, Britian, Japan, and in lesser extent Italians.  With 3 modes to choose from, being arcade, realistic battle, and sim mode, there's a gamemode for everyone.  New content being added by patches every so often  THE CONS: don't let this scare you away, at it's core it's a really great game, however, it hasn't quite reached it's full potential yet, here's why:  The grind sucks, like really really sucks, at higher tiers, when you think you've finally completed all aircraft, get prepared for an even longer grind for plane modules to make your aircraft even remotely capable.  Unbalance, again, at higher tiers you will have 1944 aircraft flying against post war aircraft and jets.  Dev team unresponsive/not listening to community. This is the main factor for me. Many people have ideas how to make the game better in their way, and of course, some of these ideas are crazy and not possible. But when an entire gaming community complains at once about certain aspects of the game, and nothing is really done, that's going to be a real negative.  All in all, it's still a great game, don't take the grind too seriously, because you will get frustrated, instead, just try and play for fun, and suddenly the game seems a lot better, yes, it has it's issues, but there's not much to be done. We can only hope our suggestion's/complaint's/bug reports will reach the dev's someday.",1,0

That said, wait for a sale. Even with the unlockables, this is NOT a $20+ game.

469920,hackmud,"  Well, let's review it.  Hackmud is a great game in my opinion. It does have some flaws BUT it is as far as I know a One-Man-Project and to create such a game alone is probably quite hard. I do have some experience with Linux + Coding in general, so the start was a bit easier for as it may be for others. E.g. my buddy bought this game for both of us, i do have experience, he doesn't. It is way harder for him to learn or understand some things in this game but he tries to learn and improve himself.  That showed me that this game is not only for people who know some stuff and more, but also for someone who does not give up and tries to learn more and more. It may be way harder but you got to start somewhere.  It's like the Dark Souls of Coding. You have to be careful who you trust and which script you run. (But you can trust dtr, he is a really nice and supportive guy. He even made an email-Account just for this game and you can mail him. Can't really say much about the others but be careful that v doesn't fools you.)  I also read some reviews and 1 negative review was quite interesting. He/She said that you can only write 1 line in your small scratch'book'. Well He/She didn't know that you can write more lines. Just hit STRG+Return/CTRL+Retunr/CMD+Return while you're 'writing' inside of it and boom you have a new line.  I also don't know much about server issues. Since I got the game it runs fluently and i never got a unwanted dc.  But I do have a really big issue: It is veeeery hard to get some GC (Money) once you're out of the prologue. Almost every low-tier NPC is already hacked and henceworth you can't get money to init your system. That way you can't upload any public scripts and more. I put about 4-5 hours into the game just to find some existing NPCs just to get the message that they are already hacked.  All in all it is a solid game, even though it is very hard to get some money. I like it, i will play it for a while and if you're interested in such games and you're not scared to learn and put many hours into a game than this might be something for you. Just be cautious, don't get fooled, try to learn and be patient.",1,0

413420,Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair,"This game asks the player to have a basic understanding of hydrolysis and relative densities of gases and the resultant properties of that, but does feel the need to remind you what an octagon is.  Seriously though, it's a good game if you like mysteries and watching characters that you get really attached to die (wait, what?).   Pros:   Well-made and interesting cases to solve   new and improved trial minigames are better than the first game   Original and more unique characters than the first game's (though those who do make a return appearance are a nice touch)   Cons:   Some of the cases require outside-the-box thinking or incredible attention to detail that I just don't think is logical.   Some minigames, especially Hangman's Gambit, can become overwhelming   The themes of the game and its setting clash really badly   Someone was worried about a murder occurring, so they confiscated everyone's forks.  Personal Taste:   Some of the characters, notably Peko and Nagito, can have their voice lines drowned out by music.   Gifting system is complicated and a community guide is basically required to go anywhere with it   Some of the depicted deaths are fairly brutal   It really sucks sometimes when your favorite character turns out to be a cold-blooded killer   In short, buy the first game first for a taste of this style and if you find you like it come here and prepare yourself for ~25 hours of reasoning, logic, child murder (Again, someone made a game about this?), and some seriously weird twists.

620,Portal 2,"Portal 2: A serious review.   So if the opening line of this review caught your attention, it might be that you're like me. You wanted to read some reviews before buying this game and you quickly got fed up with most of the 'most helpful' reviews giving absolutely no real information about what the game is like. Instead, you get the feeling that anybody who's played this game has sustained permanent brain damage. To not go on any longer, here are 5 reasons why I think Portal 2 is one of the best games I've ever played.  1. Graphics: The game is beautiful! Portal (1) looked great and it was released in 2007. Portal 2 looks 10x better! The game doesn't use too many resources so an average gaming PC or laptop will run it at max settings without a problem.  2. Physics: One of the greatest elements of this game is the amazing physics. You will have great fun discovering how to use the portals and other tools supplied to navigate and solve the well thought out puzzles. The game requires you to use forward momentum, perfect timing and fast thinking (amongst many other things) to complete puzzles. There is never a dull moment.  3. Pacing: The developers has again achieved a perfect sweet spot between making the puzzles challenging but not impossible. The game starts out with a few simple puzzles that really help you understand the basics of the game and how you can best use the portals and other tools to your advantage. After that the game gradually ramps up the difficulty keeping the game challenging and fun. With some patience and perseverance you can play through this whole game without having to consult a single walkthrough.  4. Dark Humor: Portal 2 returns with more characters than Portal 1 and the scripts are again absolutely hilarious. The game treats you as what you are a test subject and the machines are as you would expect them to be, cold and calculating in carrying out their agenda. However, I have to admit that GLaDOS was funnier in Portal 1.  5. Story &amp; Uniqueness: This game continues the surprisingly compelling story of Portal 1. I didn't think a puzzle game would have any decent kind of story but boy, was I wrong! Portal 2 is in a class of its own as an fps puzzle game that offers many hours of fun, challenging puzzles and great, hilarious scripts. My only regret is taking so long to finally play it.  P.S: these 5 points apply to both Portal (1) and Portal 2. I highly recommend you play Portal (1) first because it helps you paint a more complete picture of the full story and there are plenty of references to Portal (1) in Portal 2, including some steps in solving puzzles.  Thanks for reading. Do yourself a favor and buy this game! ",1,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"A great shooter to play with friends. Although it has a free to play set up, and everything can be puchased with money making the game pay to win, you can still get almost all of the items and guns by just playing. Lots of zerg based tactics with squads and platoons. The best is getting with a group of people and just roaming around capturing areas. It takes quite a bit of learning the map to know how to play. But once you understand the systems, its pretty easy to find a huge battle to fight in. The graphics are amazing especially considering how much is going on at once on the screen. There is everything from class systems for on the ground units, to vechile and air combat. Since the game is f2p they will try to get you to spend some money on skins or gun upgrades but none of it is really needed. Its all about multiplayer though as no single player story is added. Also the character customization is very limited when creating your character. If you have played Guild Wars 2 World vs World, or Elder Scrolls online Server vs Server, expect much of the same but with guns. Its worth giving a try, and if you like it you can always spend some money to support the devs. Reccomend for any shooter fan wanting something on a greater scale.",1,0

113400,APB Reloaded,"Having been riding shotgun on this rocky slope since the engine first breathed life, I've bared witness to the rise and fall of many events both majestic and miniscule. From the very beginning, connecting across the ocean to the Real Time Worlds European server to participate in the closed beta program through one scheduled hour a week, I felt that there was something metaphysical at work. Something without form, without function, sleeping beneath the silver sheen of this seemingly genre changing cops and robbers MMO.   There was something there behind the flying bullets, the untapped expression of creativity driven forth from every player, the static walls of San Paro and it's fleeing citizens. Like a father watching his infant son strike his first fluke homerun well out of the confines of the park, I remember excitedly tossing and considering the possibilities of a game like APB. It was destined for many things, much of which can only be described as allegory in light of the failed future this game was given by fate.   The son that knocked the ball out of the park, he could have been in the Major Leagues. He could have been so much more. Instead, somewhere between that first fluke shot and college, he found drugs and greed and turned that bat into a tool of violence for the dealer that provided him with his fix. The story of APB, sadly, is not that much different.  I stand now with a precious handful of survivors that took the train and never got off, and it is from this seat that I can humbly nominate APB Reloaded for the 'Monument To What Could Have Been' award.

However, I would hardly call it a bad game. It's free, to begin with. It's got fun, fast paced gunplay, with lots of room for mechanical outplays when being played by good players. The guns each have their own unique personality, and they all feel fun to use. To be frank, it's more fun than a lot of triple A FPS games I've played.

203810,Dear Esther,"Not so much an interactive game as an exploration into tragedy, loss and grief told through one man's journey across a desolate, Hebridean island. Dear Esther is more like a form of slow and very intentional interactive art, akin to viewing a captivating painting where you're suddenly allowed to step inside the frame and experience the scene in its entirity as you desire rather than be confined to just one perspective.  The story is conveyed in fractured pieces of spoken memory of old letters - or possible delusion - and left to the player to construct for themselves as different readings are presented at specific points along your journey, the semi-random nature of these readings meaning multiple playthroughs are required for them to be fully imparted to you.  Touching and visually captivating in equal measure, Dear Esther is a brief yet nonetheless poignant example of how the medium of gaming is more than capable of producing beautiful and contemplative works that can provoke great emotion, backed by a strong musical score setting the perfect wistful tones to accompany the bleak isolation and inward reflection of the journey. If you have the interest and willingness to explore such things then this will reward you greatly.",1,0

It's a potentially deep subject to cover and, despite how prevalent it is in the world, many games don't attempt to talk at length about how our reliance on modern machinery and tech in general affects us.   Sadly, for all it's lofty goals, Watch Dogs is more an open world game that beats it's message into you rather than a contained story involving true thought provoking techniques and ideas.   It is a graphically impressive game, full of reflective surfaces and mostly smooth frame-rates, but the world still manages to feel dead despite it's population. The easiest example of this is anytime you drive a car near a curb with people nearby. The first time someone mocks you for driving so 'badly,' you may get a feeling of immersion. The fiftieth, often from multiple people saying it at exactly the same time? Not so much.  It may seem like a small thing but the repetition the game brings will wear on you, and do so quickly. Pedestrians are often obvious color palette swaps of one another, the facial models and even clothing worn multiple times in the same crowd. Whatever their reasons for this, the developers of Watch Dogs managed to create a world full of people...that don't make you think of people at all. Instead, they are marionettes. Their strings tugged to make them move in what could almost be considered a lifelike performance.  The game play itself, outside of this full yet somehow artificial world, is once again at odds with itself. The game tries very hard to sell you on your character's skills and feelings about how those with power use it but, at the end of the day, he is an amoral man who does things just as bad (often worse actually) than the people he is claiming to fight against. An example is how you are often asked to stop crimes in progress, only to turn around and hack the person  you just saved  so that you can drain money from their bank account to add to your own. The game makes no mention of this being so obviously wrong and hypocritical, but it's there all the same. Story beats follow much the same path, asking you to do things it frowned upon only seconds earlier.   On that topic, the story itself is a mess. Considering what I've just mentioned and in how it's told to begin with, the line between what you do and what you're adversaries do is so thin already but the plot's pacing does it no favors. Characters will be killed off or introduced in ways that make little sense, breaking what little flow the game is trying to maintain.  All this being said: There is a good game in here somewhere. The controls work well, the shooting is tight and, like I mentioned, the graphics are well done. In addition to all that, when the hacking angle is played well, it's a really fun time. A perfect example of this is the 'Song Sneak' app that the game makes a part of your cell phone. If you're near what sounds like a new song, whether it's playing on a newsstand or from a nearby car in the game world, you can start the app and it will add the song to your available playlist. It's a small feature but it shows potential for innovation further along in the series.  I mentioned at the beginning of this review that it was a hard one to write and that is really for one main reason: For everything that it could have been, Watch Dogs is an open world game that falls too easily into one of many generic descriptors. I hope that a sequel is in the works, if only to see this idea given a proper showing but, as it stands now, I can't recommend the game to anyone unless they've got a great deal on it, an empty weekend or, sadly, both.",-1,1
284390,The Last Door - Collector's Edition,The Last Door was a fantastic adventure game with mystery and horror combined into one small pixelated treat. It also has a fantastic soundtrack. The music and sounds throughout the game just help set the mood perfectly.  It doesn't take long to beat the 4 chapters in this first season but it's well worth playing. The storytelling was great and the whole mystery behind everything is something I definitely want to see to the end.  If you want a good adventure game to play than look no further.,1,0

235540,Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide,"At first I was enthralled by it. But after some repeat games, and lacking rewards I find the game is missing quite a bit.  Pros    Great design.  Level design is solid. Character design is great. It all fits together nicely in terms of direction, and how things play out.    Satisfying gameplay.  Cutting or blasting your way though mobs of Skaven is very satisfying. Taking off heads, making those precision headshots when an enemy is rearing for an attack on you. It's all good. It adapts Left 4 Dead's system of gameplay, except for finding weapons in the maps. What you start with is what you get. You find things like healing items, buff potions, and bombs.     Great audio.  Soundtrack, voice acting, weapon sound effects. It's all good. Not much to say here. Certainly nothing to complain about.    Devs do communicate  on the forums, are aware of the bad loot system, and are already planning a fix for all of it. This is a huge deal.    Not Good/Bad    The Loot system.  It's a great idea I wish we would have seen in Left 4 Dead games (I also wished you had a persistent inventory). But what keeps it from remaining in the Pro list is that it's completely unreliable, and sometimes, downright insulting. It's consistent at best. You may get the roll you want off of playing a single game. You might get trash items for hours. You might conquer a tough map with grimoires/tomes and still get nothing. It doesn't reward you for an honest games work. RNG can be great in games, but while player enjoy the 'luck' aspect of some games, its not a great platform to make your characters depend on when it comes to progression. It needs modified in some way.     Linear.  If I recall L4D correctly, I remember branching/changing paths in some missions. Meaning it wasn't necessarily the same game over and over. I don't see that here. And while its great to be familiar with the game, once you've played each level a couple of times, there isn't much to look forward to. You're just focused on finishing the map, so you can see if you can get a good roll, and get that Rapier you want.   Cons     No real RPG system.  No perks, no stats, Don't give it a level-up system and call it an RPG if it really isn't one.    Small weapon selection.  There needs to be a lot more. Thats all that can be said.     Bugs.  They happen. Game breaking bugs. Where you're just simply walking, and then you're simply dead and unable to be revived.     Missing basic multiplayer features.  There doesn't seem to be any votekick. It just host has all the power. Mic use doesn't reliably work either. Sometimes I can talk to my team, sometimes I can't.     (Pet peeve) Devs: When I Alt-Tab out of a game.... I don't want the game to be set in Bordered Window mode.  FIx that ♥♥♥♥. It's annoying.     No Offline mode.  You can play singleplayer, with bots. But you have to be online. It's 2015, devs. There's not really an excuse anymore for not having your game completely Offline capable. Get with it.     Summary: I can recommend the game, but don't expect much from it. If you plan on playing alone, with pub players you probably won't get much out of it. It can get repetitive, and the rewards for all your hard work are not gaurenteed. But you can enjoy hacking and slashing your way through droves of enemies. The game is gorgeous and plays well. It just needs some more content, and some moderate tweaks to what it has now to make it a fully replayable and deep game.",1,0

404790,Godot Engine,"I do game development since several years. I jumped from one engine to another. With Godot I finally can develop a game on Linux from the start to the end. It's still a young game engine but it has an incredible development pace. I follow its development since last year through GitHub, Facebook and I have to say what others say as a marketing term this game engine really does democratizing game development. It's open source (MIT License) without strings attached, the main developer(s) listen to the community and welcoms everyone who wants to help in the development, documentation and growth process.   Some technical notes: When we have to talk about the technical stuff right now the 3d stuff is really just at the start (although If I take a look around what people often produce with other game engines they could easily do the same with Godot) . One Problem as of now are the shadows and performance in large scenes. That said the 2d part, the custom scripting language, the editor (written in Godot and its GUI itself which proofes the power of it) everything fits so well together. If you come like me from a background with other game engines then you might need some days to fully grasp the concept and its underlying power. But then it makes just click and you see a really powerful game engine that has a lot of potential to become a serious competitor even for commercial grade games. The actual renderer is based on OpenGL (ES) 2.0, which as of right now is perfect for targeting Mobile,Webbrowsers (seems that most WebGL implementation are on par with OpenGL ES 2.0) and of course the desktop. There is an upgrade (and rewrite) planned for the 3d related stuff to OpenGL ES 3.0 which will come with Godot 3.0. In my opinion a lot of people underrate the possibilities with the actual renderer. I'm sure we will soon see some people prooving to be a good alternative to other game engines out there. (And let's not forget it's free to use without big restrictions like a lot of other game engines)  Scene nodes concept: What I love about Godot is the scene node concept it follows. A lot of engines have some kind of scene node or scene graph based concept. But Godot makes it in a really simple and yet smart way. A scene consists of multiple scene nodes (of all sort of types of nodes for 2d,3d,gui, own defined with modules etc.) . A scene can also contain other scenes within its hierarchy. The keyword here is 'instanced scenes', which allows to add scenes in other scenes and people can work on different parts of a big scene without having to fear to break the scene hierarchy, it's really great. Together with Godots use of source version control friendly file formats this makes for me a great choiche for a collaboration. (Be it a collaboration for a commercial game or a game for a game jam). I love the scene node concept as it's main goal is that with one look at the hierarchy you already know where everything is and how it is organized (try that with componend based design where you have to first select objects (and find them first) before seeing which components they contain.   GUI: In some simple words: smart, powerful, easy The editor has everything you need to layout things. GUIs can be 2d on top of 3d content (like we see in every game) or it can be 2d within the 3d content. You need a menu on a display which is made as a 3d model? No problem. With Godot it is easy to set it up. I saw recently a demo where a guy made a 3d game where there was a tv and game console in a room and you could start playing a 2d game on that 3d modeled tv. So a game within a game. I know it's also possible with other game engines, but with Godot it's really easy to set these things up, the editor is just easy to use.  Everything can be animated: With everything I really mean everything! Every kind of property can be animated (so it will be interpolated if the values are float based, set and unset if they are boolean like etc.), But also function calls can be part of an animation track. Animating is so easy just some clicks and you have a animation ready to play. I made a simplistic day/night animation for instance in just 2-3 minutes lol  Extendibility: You can write plugins in GDScript (Godots own scripting language which has some similarity with Python but is not Python as it is a scripting language made for game development).  And you can develop modules in C++. If you had problems integrating C++ libraries in other engines, you might be surprised how easy it is to do it with Godot, thanks to the nice binding functions offered by it.   My opinion so far: My opinion is that we are seeing the start of what can become the Blender of the game engines out there.  If you need a high performance hardcore graphic solution for a game with large scenes then Godot might be the wrong choice rigth now. But it doesn't hurt to try it. It's easy to learn and you don't need to register any account with it.  I'm happy with it. Btw I used Unity, Unreal and Cryengine among other game engines and while I think that they are far superior in some areas especially in 3d rendering, I also think that they could learn a lot from Godot's simplicity of use and how it organizes some stuff.  As of now you can use it without any doubts for every kind of 2d game, 3d game (if not ultra realistic hardcore graphic is aimed- which will be possible only later on), mobile games for iOS,Android and even Blackberry. Browsergames (so you can develop 2d and 3d games without needing a plugin). And it runs on the typical 3 operatin systems for the desktop: Windows, Linux and Mac OS X plus people even made ports for FreeBSD, Haiku (which a lot don't even know it exists) and someone tested it on Raspberry Pi too. This is possible thanks to the permissive license.  I made my choice and I guess I will continue to use it for a long time. I feel that this game engine has potential to become really important. But again as said try it and valuate it if you need more or if it has everything you need right now.  What lacks is still the documentation but it's getting better and better, we'll see",1,0

313340,Mountain,"A mix of thriller and an mmorpg (potential wow-killer), Mountain covers the life of Mountain, from birth to ultimate annihilation. You take care of Mountain by cleaning it, taking out the trash, and help its singing career, which could save it from the apocolypse. In its lows, fish and fire will rain from the sky but if you are good enough, you can make it rain cold hard cash (coins). If you are the type of player who likes to see things burn, lead Mountain to its demise.   I would only recommend this game to those willing to put a lot of time and effort into grooming your Mountain into success. Those who only play this shortly without allowing this game's amazing depth and quality influence your life indeed are very poor souls. In my personal experience, it takes several hundred hours with this game to fully experience it.  I have only completed Mountain a couple of times in the time I've played, and I hope to get a lot more in the future.

I nearly gave it a thumbs down because it's so bad, and you can search and find a LOT of people complaining of feeling sick trying to play it. My trick to that is walk instead of run, which isn't terrible since it's real easy to miss things and get in trouble just running right in. I do wish walking was slightly faster though, walking is more like sneaking. The other complaint I have is the 'quicktime fights'. Now a lot of people are familiar with these and don't mind them, I personally hate them. In this game they are mind numblingly stupid and should have been just cutscenes instead. There is only one outcome, you have to mash keys in the right order at the right time with no warning, so it takes about 6 deaths to get through each one memorizing the key pattern each time you make it past the next key.  Ok all that said, the game is otherwise amazing. It looks incredible, easily some of the best graphics I have ever seen. Lighting, movement, weather, everything is just stunning. Gameplay is fun and engaging. A perfect mix of combat, gathering, crafting, exploring, and survival. And, there is no HUD, just the game world, which is amazing.

367500,Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen,"Rig: Skylake Core i5 6600K 3.5ghz  ASUS Strix OC GTX960 2GB  16GB DDR4 RAM   How is this game not more of a big deal than it is. It does so many things right and has such a good swashbuckling wonder filled adventuring sort of feeling to it that you'd be mad to overlook it.  I remember buying this game in the bargain bin when it was still on the last gen consoles and feel I must have been in a bizarre place in my life to not give the game too much of a chance. I guess the shoddy frame rate didn't help matters either. However having picked this up recently on PC thinking it'd be another game destined to sit in my steam library for months with '0 hours' played in the description I've been unable to put it down!   Firstly the presentation for a game hailing from back in 2012 is actually surprisingly excellent. It might lack some of the finesse and polish of present day games but there's a surprising amount of relatively complex geometry occurring in the environments which is something that is glaringly absent when replaying last gen titles recently. Flat uninspired surfaces with equally uninspired basic textures are fairly indicative of the 7th gen consoles in many other open world games so its pleasant to see this game proves to be an exception (probably one of the reasons for the tanking frame rates on PS3 and 360).   Speaking of which, the frame rate is buttery smooth at 60fps now on PC and it looks like you should be able to achieve this on fairly modest hardware despite the recommended system requirements. Texture work is also surprisingly sharp given what I've heard from other sources around the web. Graphically the game really delivers for its price point and you should have no problem getting immersed in its world. From winding wooded trails to damp dripping caves the art design and atmosphere is excellent.  Gameplay is super fun especially once you've started acquiring a number of skills and discovered the never gets old ability to clamber on enemies and attack them a la monster hunter with super smooth animations tieing everything together beautifully and believably. The main issue I personally have with the combat is the lack of a dodge roll functionality (the dark souls vet in me misses my I frames).   Honestly I can whole heartedly recommend this game and it seems like Capcom have done a tremendous job with the port and even give you the option to play in 4k which shows they've put some thought into bringing it out into the current climate.   Incidentally, this is definitely one of the most authentically D&amp;D style experiences you'll find in a 'AAA' RPG with cheesy companions and dialogue abound and mythical creatures under every stone!",1,0

38410,Fallout 2,"In some ways, this is a direct improvement over the first. There is more stuff to do, more stuff to unlock, bigger map, etc. The character customization is deeper. That's all fine.  However, what I appreciated about the first game were its simple objectives with various free-form solutions. Fallout 2 seems to strip these away in favor of increasingly complex and awkward quests. Often, they will require speaking with specific characters who are almost indistinguishable from other, less important NPCs, and doing so in a specific procedure. The Gecko Power Plant quest is a good example of how this, combined with a lot of tedious running around, results in a tiresome game of 'who's who'. Of course, the player usually has a choice in these sorts of situations to take a moral shortcut for negative karma, but the rewards for pursuing a 'good' outcome pretty much always outweigh the rewards for 'bad' behavior. I prefer to finish quests in as complete a fashion as I can, but their weird, constricted structure here bores and angers me.  Other times, logic is sacrificed for the sake of creating gameplay. I understand that Vault 13, literally a hole in the side of a mountain, could be easily ignored, but if this Pipboy is the same one that belonged to the Vault Dweller, wouldn't it make sense for the locations canonically visited in the previous game to be on it already? At least the military base should be on there, if not the vault, but at least it's not hidden to the point of requiring a quest for exploration; Speaking of bases, what about the Sierra Army Depot? It sounds and looks like it would be big enough to be noticed just by going near it, but nope, it only appears when a certain quest is activated. There's also the Enclave power armor that's good at fooling Enclave soldiers in every situation save for the map's random events, but whatever, I'm sure someone with nothing better to do has come up with an explanation for all this. Bottom line is, the first game did not do this sort of thing. It let the player reap the full benefits of accidental discovery.  A large map is good, but the random events happen WAY too often. I breathe less often than I encounter something on the map screen. Almost every time, the enemies appearing in these events are too hard (instant death), too plentiful (slow, agonizing death), or easily outrun (waste of time). Save scumming becomes a necessity for travelling through particularly brutal areas, such as the region around Navarro, where movement needs to be taken an inch at a time, lest I come across a patrol and get a one-way ticket to the game over screen. Get the car, because that ♥♥♥♥ happens a lot less often, although there is still the occasional stop made involuntary for whatever reason.  Overall, the game is representative of living in modern day California; It's buggy (frame drops, some crashing), very disorganized, and constantly frustrating, but it has its moments, and it gets more fun after the first few hours. Bigger? Yes. Better? Maybe. It's still worth playing.",1,0

311690,Enter the Gungeon,"This is the game I wanted Nuclear Throne to be.  It plays very much like that, but is a true roguelike, which Nuclear Throne is not.  If you have played Nuclear Throne, or its freeware prototype Wasteland Kings, then you'll have a good idea what to expect. The general controls and gameplay are nearly the same.   There are a ton of different guns to find, as well as a ton of passive and active use items. You start with four classes available to you (five if you count the co-op only class) and there are a couple you can unlock. Since it's a roguelike, it also has permadeath and you're gonna die a lot. This isn't an issue, though, as the game keeps giving me that 'just one more run' feeling.  The enemy roster is pretty varied, and they all have different and unique bullet patterns, which really make them interesting. This also helps keep the game fresh, as two rooms with enemy loadouts that are nearly the same but not quite can play totally different.  There is an in-game book that logs all the items you find, and things you kill. Each has a bit of flavor text, which help add to the lore of the game, which is a nice touch.  This game has one really huge negative, which is the utterly confusing lack of online co-op. If this would get addressed in a patch, this would be a near perfect game for me.",1,0

350780,MANOS: The Hands of Fate ~ Director's Cut,"This is my only serious review because this game is on several of my friend's wishlist and I want to warn them.  This game is really horrid, it's basicly everything wrong with NES homage games. It looks ugly as hell, the game design seems intended to kill you instead of giving you a challenge to deal with. Even if this game was made bad in a ironic way, there is no actual fun to be derived from that. The only humor in it is 'Did you see this MST3K episode? Well here's a reference to that'. Which I wouldn't mind if I was speaking to my nerd friends, but just saying 'look at these funnier people and what they joked about' does not constitute as a good joke for it's own premise.  About half the levels take place in the dark with only a small cone of light around you, which wouldn't be so bad if your cone of light wasn't barely bigger than your character. This creates a large amount of problems because the game just loves to throw enemies at you that knock you back into pits. You could potentially deal with this problem by just shooting what's coming up, but a lot of enemies home in on you from above, where you cannot shoot or are outright invincible. The final level is a auto-scrolling level that goes up, while you can't see what's actually appearing above. If you go too fast you will not notice the ball and chain that has just spawned that will knock you back all the way. There is a moment where they do this twice, one after another.  There is one level which is a plane level where you control a huge ♥♥♥ plane that covers atleast 1/6th of the screen. You die in one hit and it is nearly uncontrollable. The boss of that level is a giant chicken head and a plane which shoots small bullets you can barely see.  The game also just loves to cheat, early on there is a boss which changes your invincibility period to half a second, thus causing it to hit you multiple times if it so deems. This boss also is later reused in another game made by the same developer, so that tells you the effort put into it.  The music is decent, though. It's functional and does it's job well, never sounding unpleasant. However, not the same can be said of the sound effects. There is one enemy in the game that has a noise that can be accurately described as 'Screamer midi as back in the dial up days'. There is a UFO enemy that's spawned everywhere in one level that just the most painful noise known to man.  If you want to get a good homage to old NES games, I would suggest Shovel Knight. It is a better game than most NES games. If you want a funny bad game, just play Bad Rats, it's better than this is ever gonna get.  Oh also, the game outright didn't want to accept my DualShock 3 controller, no matter what program I used or input I set it at.  Update: As of this date, the dev has personally told me that they added a health bar to the plane level, this atleast negates my criticisms about that part. (Also 69% found this review helpful right now which is in fact Very Nice)  Update 2: The dev of this game tweetsearches himself and whined about this review for 3 days on his twitter. Got blocked when I told him in 3 different ways to stop tweetsearching himself. I have pretty much done what every game journalist sets out to do, so I now know what career I have perfected.  Update 3: He apologized, we all good.",-1,1
289090,Ampu-Tea,"This game isn't worth $5. Maybe $1 or $2, but not $5.  The game is just using the principle from Surgeon Simulator: you have specific control over a hand, and you must perform a task while trying to get a hold of the odd control method. Except in Ampu-tea, the goal is to just make a cup of tea rather than performing various surgeries.  One of the problems with Ampu-tea is that the (supposedly prosthetic) hand isn't attached to anything. You can just make it fly around the room like some sort of... I dunno. Helicopter? Flying Insect? Anyway, the game doesn't have any proper limits on where the arm can be moved.  Another issue is the lack of any sort of menu. You have a text box in the top right corner of the screen telling what certain keybings are (changing difficulty, disabling music, etc.), and a menu that pops up when you first start the game asking what language you want. Other than that there are no menus, and even then, the language select menu doesn't have mouse control, and is operated through pressing keys such as F1, F2, F3, and so on and so forth. There are also no performance options, you can't even change the screen resolution, leaving you with some pre-determined resolution rather than what your monitor actually uses. Another thing: people are saying that the translations are terrible for the different languages. I only speak english, so I can't tell for sure..  The game assets are weird too. There's a bunch of stuff on the table that has no reason to be there that could harm game performance on slower machines. Examples of these things are: random cloth rags with the words 'keep calm and make tea' on them, an 'out of order' tea kettle, and one of those horse head masks that are so popular on the internet (seriously? putting in an irrelevant internet meme just for a giggle?  It's not even funny in this context. ). Also, the devs supposedly had to increase the gravity in the game just because everything in the game wasn't scaled properly (as in, everything is smaller than it should be).  The scenery consists of a terribly-made room with bad texturing (seriously,  just look at that fridge. The texture used on the front is used on the side, too! ) and way more free space than you need.  The overall game lacks content and isn't executed very well. This shouldn't be on steam, this should be on a website like kongregate or something.  It's just not worth spending money. ",-1,0

246700,,"These kinds of games are rare, and beyond that, these kinds of games that are revolutionary, are rare. What kind am i refering to you might wonder?  Well, steep learning curves, solid and true pvp, and no holds bard glorious pvp action that gets your blood pumping even when losing, there is just something about bieng completely outnumbered, that pushes you beyond your capabilities, forces you to pull deadly death defying lunatic manouvers around these elaborate well thought out complexes. they have thrown in plenty of small gaps for you to brave in the middle of a dogfight, every single game i find myself ninja through one at least once. And the real kick to the teeth, I SUCCEED!  People say the controls suck, i completely and utterly disagree, if i am capable of these insane, near impossible to pull off manouvers less than 10 hours into playing the game, How by the life and death of all that is genetic, the controls bad?  With the simple flick of the mouse you can preform a true barrol roll, immelmen, immelmen turn, all of it and it doesnt even stop there. they truly capture the elemement that proves, up and down are non existant and throw that into the gameplay that allows for a wicked fun time. This game needs more support yes, its player base is struggling, and im enjoying it during the sale that has boosted the population.  Please people, stick with it! this game with new content will pathe the way for future games and can become so much more than it already is!  you might think with the steep learning curve that the game will be annoying, tough, and will force you to rage quit, well sure there have been plenty that have done just that, but i believe they all have one thing in common. they didnt sit down and try out the controls in a safe enviroment, they took one look, died, and quit. it doesnt take long to get to grips with the controls.  Just play a challenge mode if you hate tutorials like i did, by the time you finish it, you'll be ready to at least, survive, and pull off the insane manouvers that i refer to completely by accident and succesfully!  So now you might be thinking, if these crazy and insane manouvers are possible, then surely it must be nearly impossible to kill with weaponry such as miniguns, unguided missiles, and so on. again, not true, this game offers a really cool weapons choice to fit your playstyle no matter what it may be, if you used to play Air rivals/SCO you can don the B-gear cape once again and use free fire rockets, shotguns, and point blank people, or simply directly blast them in the face, and this is so easy to do, the game becomes somewhat a joust with these weapons.  the miniguns and contact reliant weaponry, dont let the shakeyness fool you, its easy to do. you get behind an enemy, and you can follow him, any manouver he can pull, you can too, you can cut the corners of his manouvers easily, catch him and kill him. you'll be doing it in no time i assure you, this games learning curve is not as steep as you might think.  For those too lazy to read through the entire review, fair enough, lazyness is in overabundance these days.  The game is easy to learn, hard to master. it is great fun. You can pull off break neck manouvers with ease and more succesfully than ever. You can succesfully follow these manouvers with easy, thereby adding far more depth to pvp combat counters to counters to counters. Aiming isnt nearly as hard as you might think.

The progression system keeps you on your toes, trying not to die to lose your precious XP that you need to unlock new weapons. Overall, this is one of the most relaxing chaotic games on Steam and I don't see why you shouldn't buy it.   Rating:8/10",1,0

270880,American Truck Simulator,"American Truck Simulator feels more like a downloadable add-on for Euro Truck Simulator 2 than it does a standalone game.  While the locale and trucks are different, the aesthetic and UI remain exactly the same.   Nonetheless, I am thoroughly enjoying ATS, cruising through Nevada, getting my deliveries done. I highly recommend this to anyone who has played ETS (The $19.99AUD pricetag is more than justifiable), or those that are on the fence about whether to purchase a truck simulator or not.   Should you be a newbie, and faced with the choice between ETS 2 and ATS, I'd strongly recommend going with ETS 2.   New additions such as police cars that become portable speed cameras and roads that become flooded with tumbleweeds give a fresh feel, but it's still just ETS 2 (not that that's necessarily a bad thing).   7.5/10  tl:dr - It's a good game, but glorified DLC for ETS 2.",1,0

206190,Gunpoint,"It's fun. It's different. It takes a little getting used to. But it's... Disapointingly short. I remember playing the demo and thinking that this was going to be a fantastic game... And well... it is and it isn't. It took me less than 3 hours to 100% the game, minus a few odds and ends achievements that I could go back and do in less than 10 minutes. Don't buy this if you expect a good value for your money, because 5 dollars an hour is more expensive than the average movie time to price value. Laughably easy, a story that seems shoehorned in to try and keep the gameplay in line and a gadget variety so small you really do feel like a spy on a budget. Don't expect the gameplay to change from switching light switches to doors and cameras to doors until the last level, where a 'big' surprise lies in wait for you. (Hint: It's not that big, but it changes how you can tackle early levels.)  Shortcap: In less than 3 hours you can A+ every level, get 95% of the achievements and crush the story without mercy. Not worth 10 bucks, but 5 dollars or less it's a solid buy, especially if you're a big supporter of indie games.  I'm a little disapointed by the creator, as this game could have gone seriously far. I hope to see a sequel or better yet, a free expansion that adds some content.  I give it a 2.5 out of 5 stars.",1,0

415840,Mystic Saga,"The Steam Community will like this 'free to play' Hidden Object game far better then the last one (Lost Lands: A Hidden Object Adventure), for one, the achievements are far easier to get and are in sync with the area leveling. Achievements are earned at the first level up. Though I am sure many will still complain about microtransactions that NEVER, EVER have to be done.   The player levels up relatively fast giving the player a full energy bar to continue playing. There are 38 locations in total to open. There are also two nice features at the bottom of the page, a diary and main story quest log, so the player can keep track of the storyline.  The Hidden Object scenes start out with 3 items and the items increase at each level. Also the player is encouraged to chain the object finds to increase the 'prizes' of XP, money, items, and energy. A special area feature is the little picture by each area name indicting the type of HO scene available. 'Sun' is straight find list. 'Hand and sun' Silhouette mode. 'Moon and stars' Night mode. This makes it much easier to know, find and anticipate certain modes when needed for quests.  Much easier play style compared to other games of this type, with far less grinding then usual and who can beat the price of FREE, so give it a try if so inclined.",1,0

273070,The Last Federation,"The BEST worst (or worst BEST) purchases I've ever made.  PROLOGUE OF THE REVIEW: After reading a ton of reviews, seeing some gameplay vids, I've concluded those people are just shills trying to make an 'avant garde' game sound like something it totally isn't.  Why would they do that?  Because no one would buy this FRIGGIN' type of game as-is, at-all, ever--if they truly knew what genre it is. UNLESS, they've been duped into buying it cuz others have misrepresented its genre. OR, they're familar with this genre, or want something entirely fresh, or are cult-like followers of the developer (we've seen them folks around before, haven't we people?).  So this devolves into semantics, which is not good start for this game. It appears to me: fans seem to go out of their way to paint it incorrectly. Despite that, IS THIS a GOOD game?  GENRE IDENTITY CRISIS: First, let's clarify the game's genre. It's unique. That sums it up. In my opinion, it's a TURN-BASED PUZZLE GAME in a SCI-FI STRATEGY SETTING, with some ARCADE-LIKE ACTION SEQUENCES.  GAMEPLAY: You START out at the menu with a plethora of gameplay options. Honestly, these don't mean diddley squat because the game is like NOTHING you've ever played, it makes no sense to tinker around with any of this. Seriously. Instead, just try to pick what seems like the 'default' gameplay, and start. This way, you'll get an idea of how it is. If you want, you can adjust things to make it 'easier' for noobs, err, newbs. Which is hilarious because...  ...after you click through the pages of still images reading all the text telling the story, you'll be dumped into the game and have ABSOLUTELY NO BLOODY IDEA WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON.  There is a MAP of 'space'. Fans call it 'map of the galaxy'.  What a joke. It's roughly around 10 planets/locations.  SO, you play this monsterous alien hydra titan that looks like it could devour Cthulhu.  Your the last of a race whose world/people are wiped out, and you can work to unite the races or destroy 'em or whatever. You don't control 'your own empire'. You're more of guy 'behind the scenes' spending the entire game manipulating the other races.  Other races have 1 Planet.  NOT some 'empire'.  So how do you PLAY THIS? You basically spend almost the whole game clicking on menus.  You can click on the other worlds/places and you immediately 'zip' across to there. Then, you get to access THEIR menus, to see the things you can click on to do. Like: hire some guys, hire some researchers, help them develop something, sell them some tech, help with something else. Very detailed menus (and everything is detailed UP THE WAZOO with descriptions), explain the PROS and CONS of each option.  Approx. 80% or more of anything you find on any of the menus you are told YOU CAN'T DO, because you need to raise rep, or do something else, or get special points in something, and there's a huge plethora of INFO about each of those things to figure out what the hamhock-heck they are.  If you CAN ACTUALLY find something it WILL let you do...SHOULD you do it? AND THAT'S where the genius of the strategy/puzzle aspect encompassing this game is at! Doing an act, might lower relations with another race, for example. You might upset 'the balance' or whatever.  If you decide to do the act, you...CLICK to do it. Then, just spam END-TURN until a text pops-up and says something like 'OK, THAT'S DONE'. Actually, it's way more 'wordy' than that. But...'SAME DIFFERENCE!'.  So you see if you got credits or points in something, it goes from 500 to 625 or whatever. Big accomplishment! Rep with these guys goes 100 to 105 and THOSE guys, moves 95 to 85. Or whatever.  That's it.  At some point, you get to do other things. You just have to do all this kind of stuff alot. AND I MEAN, ALOT.  Making it easier, is you can set the 'End Turn' thing on a sort of 'AUTO-PILOT' so you don't have to tire your fingers spamming. Rather, the game will end the turn for you, sparing you the tediuous monotony.  Some 'things' you get to do, will take you to an 'ARCADE GAME' where you have to dodge spinning balls, and stuff. Reminds me of the simplicity of Space Rangers 2's 'Arcade Sequences', but in SPACE, like above a planet, with way better graphics. The Arcade Sequence, like most Arcade Games, plays out in 'real time'. Get hit too much by the bullet/object spam orgy things, you die.   So, don't let that happen!  After that's over, it's back to the 'space map', clicking on menus to see what else teh game will 'let you do'.  The SPACE-TECHNO soundtrack, makes this all feel REALLY important.  What makes this game so cerebral, is that YOUR decisions AFFECT the huge galaxy...of like around 7 measily planets. Maybe one races destroys another, ALL OF THE SUDDEN! Or destroys the one that are your puppets...it feels like a historical gaming industry moment!  Incredibly thought-provoking, worthy of thousands of pages of forum drooling!  So deep and provocative, and IN NO way randomly generated. It makes the game feel comparable to the Encyclopedia Britannica, reading Aristotle, or Homer.   No, literally on that first one. Just one page about anything in the game, is loaded with so much detail, it's like a novel. You should get a Steam Achievement if you actually read just one of the pages (in its entirety).  And some fans claimed this was a 4X game, where you build fleets and conquer them like in Master of Orion, GalCiv, and other well-known 4X games. Others, compared it to being 'just like Drox Operative' (which is an open-world ARPG arcadish space-ship game).  It ain't. Not even close! Others know FULL WELL, the type of game it is...like an overwhelming aroma that splashes into the mind, then swirls, and swirls around.  **OVERALL RATING** : E=mc^2 out of 10.  PROS: So many menus you get to click on, surrounded by really good static backgrounds with great artwork, some animations. Visually, it's very colorful. It's like reading a 1000 page Isaac Asimov dribble with rainbow rave-party club lights dancing on the pages. Sometimes GREEN txt, sometimes another color. The artwork is top-notch, the story setting itself is very good, and I enjoy the idea of playing some mastermind behind the scenes. The game offers differing gameplay types. Given how enriching the moving dots &amp; triangles on the 'space map' are, the entertaining evade and/or blow-up everything Arcade sequences are, I decided the route of wiping out everyone. (Any surprise?).  CONS: I can't think of cons with the game, but rather, with the rabid fans that misrepresent what type of game this is. THEY ARE THE REAL CONS. So are some reviewers with their videos, only showing the (few) 'mass-appeal' aspects of the game [example: skipping CORE GAMEPLAY, and showing only the 'arcade' sequences. Many 'REVIEWERS (and THE DEVELOPERS EVEN), do this]. That's really LOUSY. Many 'reviewers' give-up early (and maybe the DEVELOPERS TOO?) and say 'HEY, BUT IM SURE IT'S COOL AND YOU CAN DO ALL THOSE THINGS LIKE SOMEONE ELSE SAID.' and then END their video.  In truth, they don't want to waste another minute to play it more.  That sucks of them. Right?  SO BEWARE all the false reviews. Take the time to watch an ACTUAL gameplay vid that's like AN HOUR LONG (at least), that DOESN'T EDIT OUT THE CORE GAMEPLAY (all the menu-clicking action).  CONCLUSION: This is a PUZZLE game at its heart, involving lots of menus, clicking and waiting for something to happen. You're more likely to have to take a dump before anything does.   There's nothing wrong with that.  You need patience.  If you're a NORMAL gamer who prefers DooM or CoD, you probably won't enjoy it.  If you're a gamer with SPECIAL NEEDS in gaming, with matured, refined tastes, you'll appreciate a slow, 'cerebral' challenge.   And if you love reading, like a vampire loves blood, this game (and this review...) WILL leave you sated and quenched.",1,1

My one problem with the game is that it's poorly optimized. I could run  last light with almost everything maxed out but this game I have to turn down the graphics and the like for a steady 60fps.   In short, aye I do recommend it but be aware that it's not that well optimized. Have a good time in the tunnels :)",1,0

248570,Toribash,"First impressions: When I first saw this game it looked fun. When I got ingame and learned the concept I was disappointed. The fighting was frame by frame were each frame you say what parts you want to move and how to move them. it was way too slow and no preset move could be made to make the game faster.   Online play: I tried online play to see how that was different from the dummy. Online play is so much slower. Only one person per server may play at a time, and many people will run the timer making games last way to long, also there are up to 10 people in a server, so you could have to wait for 9 people to finish up just to get one turn, and like me you may just loose that match you waited so long for match.  Cons: Slow paced, you only have one shot to take the enemy down, and if you mess up, even for only on one frame you are dead, takes waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to long to get to play online, the short satisfaction you get on winning is no compensation for the time you have to wait, and there is not to much satisfaction in winning.  Pros: Has a possibility to be a good game, concept is great, and the short time you get to play is entertaining.  Far to slow passed to be fun, the way the servers are set up make it even worse. I by no means think this game is worth anyone's time.  I'm sorry if your opinion differs, but this is how I, as a new player felt about the game. I had no fun at all.",-1,0
316010,Magic Duels,"Fun game; but, o gosh does the computer cheat its way to victory. Starts out easy enough, but after you play for a few weeks the computer consistently and conveniently draws the required cards to either (a) destroy all your creatures, (b) disable your creatures, or (c) summon a powerful creature nullifying the creatures you have. I played 16 games over the past 2 days and for a number of straight turns in a row I drew lands, the computer drew 1-4 rare cards in time. I’ve played magic for over 15 years and remember the days of Avatars, but this game really puts a stranglehold on the fun with the AI design. Woof!

This has easily become one of my top 3 games of all time. while the gameplay is a little outdated it's not unplayable by any means and features the best story I've ever experienced in a game. I would easily pay $60 for this game as it offers at least double what most games have now a days and also features the best dlc I've played too. The dlc is almost as good as the main game and could easily be it's own game based on how much is in it and how good it is. If you even slightly enjoy RPGs I cannot recommend this game enough.,1,0

269210,Hero Siege,"[My logged online hours do not reflect hours played offline.]  There should really be a sideways thumb for games like this, but previously before all the recent updates I would have gladly given the game a thumbs up. From when I personally had played the game, the mana update had come out and the game - as it was - was perfectly fine by me. Arena-style, RPG elements, the overworld, etc. had a pretty alright feeling to it so I have nothing to ♥♥♥♥♥ about there. Graphically it's quite pleasing on the eyes. HOWEVER, I have noticed that the devs don't quite know what to do with their updates.  The constant updates keep changing things about the game nearly every time. You barely have time to get used to the new update before something else gets changed, whether minimally or completely. There is no constant 'making the game better' through slight changes or community advice. It's game-changing changes that have kept me off from playing Hero Siege further. Oh, and it's nice that you can't even complete every act because someone thought it'd be cute to release the rest of the game as DLC. Cause that makes sense, am I right? It's like if Stephen King wrote a book but only release the first two-thirds and released every chapter as a full-length book thereafter.  But here are the positives that I previously enjoyed: + The mana system was FINE. ([-] HOWEVER, acking up the skills' use of mana is pointless for having said skills at said level if you can't even use them.) + The overworld is alright. Has portals per act. Rather pointless to have though, not much to do other than sell equipment from a vendor you can't buy things from so you're left to hunt EVERYTHING down yourself (not that that's bad but it is tiresome after a while) + Graphically pleasing. Would not be surprised if they degraded it back to 8-bit or 16-bit graphics because we were all about 8 years old when the first Pokemon games came out anyway and that's how old the devs are acting. + Bosses were fun... ish. Getting through an area and mindlessly mass-murdering creatures with families and waging genocide to get to the next area left me with a tingly feeling all in my body that made me feel fuzzy. It's kept me out of prison.  - THE DAMN UPDATES. - THE DAMN UPDATES. -THE DAMN UPDATES. - Oh, did I mention the updates?  Would I buy this game again? If you like math, the probability of me buying this game ever again is 2 to the power of infinity minus one to one against. So... no.",-1,0

253940,Septerra Core,"I played this game long time ago and bought the Steam version only to leave this review. This is an RPG, heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger and maybe some other JRPGs. Very similar turn based battles with combination attacks. Just like in CT, there's a robot character, girl engineer character, etc. But crappy plot/dialogue and insane amount of mind numbing, time consuming backtracking. I attempted to play this game several times, wasted tens of hours, never finished it, deleted after one or another boring fetch quest. And plot.. I can't remember much after all these years, but it involved some evil dude hunting for some macguffin and several characters dying while trying to give my character time to escape. Yes, this dumb cliche scene occured 2 or 3 times through the game. Pre-rendered 2D graphics in 640x480 sure looked nice in 90s, but were already dated at the time of release. Its main competitor, Anachronox, also a CT-inspired western JRPG, looks much better on modern PCs, in addition to simply being better written and more fun. Also suffers from backtracking, but has 'secret' fast-forward button to make it bearable. And this game.. I would not call it bad, but it isn't Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, Xenogears, Fallout, Baldurs Gate, Planescape Torment, Dark Sun, etc. etc. So many great games, so little time.

Graphic : Amazing , beautiful views and art. Gameplay : Similar to the last one , alot of mini maps with trophies and secrets to unlock and explore. Plot : It's ok , could be better.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"'400 Bucks' achievement: 'I may be homeless, but at least I have a sick knife'  Congratulations Overkill. You don't even seem to understand irony, let alone your own fanbase.  Welcome to Payday 2 new players. Enjoy it while you can. In the future I wouldn't be surprised if Overkill starts putting a pricetag on masks, mask patterns, and materials. Anything they can do to continue making more money. Hell they will probably put special stats on masks if you fork over $50 or a few hundred dollars. People try to say 'OOOH WELL, WHO CARES? YOU CAN'T MOD THE SKINNED WEAPONS AND THE BONUSES AREN'T EVEN THAT BIG!' It's about principle. I was one of those people that didn't like how every DLC seemed to introduce the new, best weapons. The rebalance was mostly good in my eyes, save for things like them doing nothing to make the Saiga 12 (base game shotgun) anything but a lesser AA12 (DLC). So the original DLC advantadge is always going to be there. But now we have these stupidly rare skinned guns that are exactly the same as other skins except they have a bonus attached to them, making them more valuable. Oh and did I mention they are even more gaudy than the ♥♥♥♥ that gets submitted to CS:GO? I mean seriously who the hell designs this crap? No, I'm not going to use a gun that looks like it's covered in a pattern that belongs on a woman's purse. I don't care for these worthless safe drops at the end of a heist, even if it means I can earn $3 steam bucks from a drill drop now. I want masks, patterns, materials. INFAMOUS drops. Remember those? Even less of a chance of getting the cool stuff you want to make your ideal mask now. I should have downloaded goonmod and used their stupid coin system to unlock all the ♥♥♥♥ I wanted before this terrible update happened. It's great how they are trying to get away with it by implementing a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ the fanbase has been asking for forever. PDTH heists have been on everyone's wishlist.

Payday2 users, modding a gun seems so easy and wonder why it's charged so badly? Well hoenstly to say I think I get why they are so expensive to do.  I barely got into the game that much, and I just barely unlocked the two guns at the start doing what I can do with them but so far it's fascinating.  Some say the other parts are bad such as the shooting range, but isn't that like a option that you are able to do? The title itself is pretty much self-explanatory 'Gun Diassembly' so, why really bother too much about those aspects as for those there are practically infinate number of shooter games that lets you have some experieance with it.   -------------------------  Be resdy to be frustrated though as when you first pick up this game it's going to be hard, like /really/ hard if you know nothing all all about guns.

417860,Emily is Away,"Nice aesthetic. Cool pop culture references, including some that will hit you right in the nostalgia gut (dem MSN Messenger icons). The story is simple and straightforward, and one that I feel many of us may relate when it comes to situations in which we ended up just drifting apart from old friends despite still desperately trying to cling to them.  The downside is that Emily herself seems quite... 'confused', or even inconsistent at times (in one year she acts like she's bitter about this thing, the next year she seems to not want/not care about it anymore, then she's sad about it), and it's a little disappointing how your choices dont have that big an impact on the outcome and you just get that bittersweet end, no matter what.  It would be interesting to see an extended version (maybe a paid version) with more endings, more choices, and in which the side-characters play a bigger part (maybe you can chat with Travis, Mike, Emma et al.)

310790,Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions Evolved,"Geometry Wars 3 is a twin stick shooter, which is a genre that I have to admit I'm not very experienced with. I played the original on Xbox 360 but that's about it, so I can't really compare the mechanics to other games, but I've mostly enjoyed my time with GW3 so far.  Its quite a simple game, with no story to speak of. The player controls some kind of spaceship and has to shoot a variety of differently coloured enemies while trying to earn a high score. Destroyed enemies will leave behind 'geoms' which can be collected to increase the score multiplier. You die instantly if anything touches you and there are usually dozens of enemies on screen at a time, so its all about learning the movement pattern and speed of each enemy type, to avoid them.  There are 50 levels in adventure mode, which give you star ratings based on your score. Bosses are locked until you earn enough stars on previous levels, which normally I would consider to be a cheap way of extending a game, but GW3 gets away with it because most levels only last 2-3 minutes so replaying them isn't a massive inconvenience. There are also 5 'classic' modes that only have 1 map each, so their only goal is to set a high score.  The controls are designed to work best with a gamepad, so I used my 360 controller. You move with left stick and aim with right stick, and have super weapons on the two triggers which can be used a couple of times per level. You've got a supernova that instantly destroys everything on screen, and one other which the player chooses from a range of options. I liked the homing missiles because when the action gets really crazy, I didn't want to worry about aiming. I tried the mines and black hole but didn't really find a good use for them.  You can also choose between several drones that fly around and help you. The attack drone shoots enemies, and is useful when you need a bit of extra firepower, but I mostly used the drone that automatically collects geoms because the score multiplier is absolutely essential for earning stars.  The big feature for GW3 is the 3D design of the levels. While it looks impressive, it can sometimes have a negative impact on the gameplay. What I found is that many enemies spawn in places I couldn't see, so on small maps, fast moving enemies could kill me before I could react, and on large maps that have a time limit, hunting for an unseen enemy wastes valuable seconds.  The music is a good match for the fast paced action and I didn't notice any major bugs. Value for money is good. I finished the adventure mode in around 8 hours, and genre fans could probably spend countless more hours chasing high scores on the leaderboards for every map. And just before I was ready to post this review I've seen an article on IGN saying more levels will be released as a free update towards the end of March.  Overall I think Geometry Wars 3 is a pretty good game, and worth checking out if you're in the mood to just turn off your brain, relax, and shoot stuff.",1,0
246580,The Typing of The Dead: Overkill,"Hilarious, over-the-top and downright offensive, this unique shooter is just ridiculous enough to be completely entertaining from start to finish.   I almost couldn’t believe the premise of this shooter when I first saw it. Really…you kill zombies by typing words correctly? Although I’ve admittedly not played the House of the Dead games outside of arcades, I felt like I couldn’t pass up this opportunity when I saw it. I’ve never played the original House of the Dead: Overkill either, although it is baked-in along with this new keyboard-based game.   As far as game mechanics go, it’s pretty much exactly what it advertises – words will pop up on the screen above zombies, and your success is based upon how quickly and accurately you can key in those words. Your characters move from room to room on rails, sometimes barreling through an entire squadron of undead, other times not moving forward until you’ve essentially committed zombie genocide. This is one of the few games in which I feel the DLC is needed, as it increases the dictionary of words used with interesting themes, such as a Shakespeare pack or a sports lexicon. Some of the words and phrases are absolutely wacky, and I loved the challenge it provided for both my fingers and my mind.    As for the story – that’s where the real charm of this game is found. The entire adventure is presented as a grindhouse-style flick, and there’s a filter over the action that shows film noise and burns, which I felt really set a tone right from the start. Every cutscene is appropriately ludicrous and crass; the main characters swear and curse with incredible conviction, which is actually addressed within the dialogue itself during the few quiet moments between levels. Traveling between setpieces, the characters will occasionally make a comment on their situation, or their relationship in regards to each other. It’s an incredibly honest approach to the standard zombie apocalypse gore fest, and at one point the male protagonists recognize that they are stereotypical macho men going who have to save the strongest female protagonist. I really wasn’t expecting a type-‘em-up zombie game to have an interesting, existential view of the genre as a whole, and yet there it was.   Otherwise, the game is comparatively offensive and comical as an episode of South Park. You’ll hear scat jokes as you attack a giant-headed, wheelchair-bound, Stephen-Hawking-esque zombie, for example. But, the game stays so consistent with how ham-fisted it is with being distasteful that it actually is engaging and fun throughout. Had the game attempted to be serious and grim, it would have failed miserably.   I did attempt to play the original House of the Dead: Overkill which is included, but the options for controller support is very scant. There’s no option to adjust the reticle sensitivity, and as a result I felt like the crosshairs were flying all over the screen, even during slow-motion sections. It feels like the typing aspect of this game is the main attraction, which certainly isn’t a bad thing.   I don’t know the next time that one of these House of the Dead typing games will be released, but I enjoyed my time with this one so much that I’ll probably grab whatever comes next as well. Recommended for anyone looking for something entirely new to the shooting genre.",1,0

It also has an interesting story-line and structure with some unique game elements. I just had two major issues with the game. The first was that the unique elements, while being thematically relevant, didn’t really add much to the gameplay itself, but only served as slight annoyances, hindering you in a way that other tower defenses don’t. This lead to my other issue with the game and is something I’m a little reluctant to complain about since it sounds whiny… but the game was hard.  Admittedly, Shad’O was a bit of a disappointment for me as it was a good example of poor game design and ‘game features’ that took away from the game rather than adding. An interesting story was developing in front of me and I’ll probably never see the outcome as I can’t get past the first chapter.

This game is one of the only games made by the developer Arkane, and it is one of the best games I've played. You step into the shoes of Corvo, the Empress's guard. But right from the beginning, things go wrong and you are framed for the murder of the Empress. Leading you to go on a journey to get revenge and get rid of the men that framed you for the murder of the empress. This game can be played without killing anyone at all, which is a real challenge. After you beat the game that should take you about 15 hours depending on how fast you play it, there are lots of DLC's to play to extend the time. And, you can play through the levels again completely differently. I have not encountered any problems with this game 10/10",1,0

222880,Insurgency,"This game, while not perfect in my view is a great close quarters tactical shooter, or rather it is when the players try and think that way. This game rewards tactical behaivior like fire and maneuver and punishes the rambos by filling them full of lead as they sprint across a killzone. I personally can only nit pick a few critisisms.  In combination with high damage and recoil environment which makes every contact a real threat, the game manages to introduce a reasonable and important customisation system where choosing your supplies is an important decision. This allows the various classes making up both teams to adapt to the situation and give the player some flexibility.  The night maps add a further element to the game play, forcing the player spend points on either a flashlight (which lights up the area and shows his position to the enemy) or night vision googles (which are expensive and can easily be blinded by light sources).  My only siginificant dislike for this game is the respawn system. Instead of operating on the ticket system (where on ticket equals one player respawn) the game respawns purely on a limited number of a respawn waves. While in some modes it is very effective, in others it results in a player being left out of the fight because he only died once all his team's respawns had been used. A mix of ticket and wave respawns would be better in my opinion. My other complaint is (in my case) what appears to be poor optimisation. Even Arma 3 seems to be more stable on my system.  Negative points aside, if you are into tactical shooters, I highly recommend this title game. However, if your definition of a 'tactical shooter' is the latest Battlefield titles or (heaven forbid) CoD, stay away from this unless you want to end up raging about the fact you can't 'n0 sc0p3' the guy 'camping' the road.",1,0

16720,Velvet Assassin,"Velvet Assassin is a great game with a lot of history to it. Look up the main protagonist's story before or after playing the game. I would recommend before, because if you're reading this, you likely haven't bought it yet.  The graphics and gameplay are great overall. I only had some trouble with Violette's hair displaying correctly for a while, but that was fixed. It was just my graphics card and some settings being dumb. The graphics are terrific considering it was made in 2009, and the gameplay is quite solid, but slow. You'll find yourself restarting at checkpoints (which are scarce, because this is based on a true story (I imagine that's why they're scarce in this game)) quite a bit. Changing weapons takes longer than it should, and the stealth part of the game is tricky.  Even though it took me literally years on and off (this was actually my first steam game), because I would either get frustrated with the stealth part *ENEMY INCOMING ALERT OUT OF NOWHERE!*, or I bought a new game that seems more interesting ( I don't usually finish things right away, so it could just be me), I would still recommend this game.

206440,To the Moon,"I would recommend this game if you are looking for a couple hours to kill sided with a desire to ride an artful, emotional rollercoaster.  I would absolutely NOT recommend this game if you are looking for an addictive, replayable experience. I would also not recommend it if you are looking for any depth of gameplay whatsoever. This is more of a movie-game than anything I've ever played so far. Everything other than gameplay, however is top-notch.  The story, as I've said, is an absolute rollercoaster in a wonderful way. I'm not going to say a word about it though, because this game would be 100% spoiled if ANYTHING in the story was given away before the director said so. It was artfully done. One criticism I might have would be that the humor can sometimes come at times when you didn't really WANT comedic relief. Your mileage of course may vary though.  The graphics successfully portray the colorful (personality-wise and visually) characters, as well as the physical (And sometimes not-so-physical!) surroundings. They never feel cheap or rushed, and are very pleasing in my opinion.  The music is astonishing, and elevates the experience to surreal heights.  The characters are very real, and you will feel close to them if you become immersed in the game (Which is really easy.)  The gameplay, as I've said, could be called a weak point. It's quite repetitive during the first half of the game (and onward sometimes,) and if there were no story, art, and likeable characters behind it, would be ultimately boring and uninteresting.  To conclude, this game is not like many others that I've played. I enjoyed it thoroughly, though at some points the story may make you feel angry, sad, or confused (which aren't always such enjoyable emotions, but important ones nonetheless.) You will probably walk away feeling wonder-struck, pensive, and satisfied.  For $9.99, I would recommend this game if you want the previously described experience. On sale?

231430,Company of Heroes 2,"Company of Heroes 2 is a game that builds on its foundations of the original. In Multiplayer the game is usually all around capturing and holding objectives at strategic locations. Also resources like Fuel and Ammunition can be added as key objectives to secure the right units.  The Campaign feels weak and rushed and I wouldn't recommend buying the game for a single player experience. However the Multiplayer is enjoyable alone or in team play. The players online are mostly nice but ofcource some ruin it for the scene. Team games are slower paced the more people join but 1v1 and 2v2 can be a quick rush. Games average around 25 minutes and can last as long as 3 hours.   Good multiplayer strategy game, i recommend.",1,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"If you are looking for a game that will disconnect you more than most beta's for no other reason than there more than 5 people walking around... this is the game for you!  I really tried to play this game and I feel that if it was made by a Indie group there would be more effort put into making the game playable (as they would take pride in their work), instead of releasing redundant weapons and como's and other money grabbing releases in an attempt to get as much money out of their sinking ship before they finally loose their customer base to games that value performance and playability over low quality 'shiny' releases with no other goal than to satisfy Sony's bottom line.  This game is a testament to my belief that Sony should stick to making low quality televisions and faulty sound systems.",-1,0
239140,Dying Light,"I've played various free running games, and many zombies games, including Dead Island and Riptide, so this game should be home free, right? Well, not quite.  The game is gorgeous, there's no denying it. It's quite a step up from Dead Island, and DI was already quite serviceable. The voice acting is much better, and there seem to be fewer characters with endlessly repeating lines (and where they occur, they're less ridiculous).  The writing is a bit of a mixed bag -- there are some awesome, emotionally resonating bits (I liked the bit with the wizard, and the Kid who would be a Detective), and while there are a number of side quests you wouldn't realistically risk your life for, there are few where you'd like to punch the quest giver in the face for even suggesting it.  Unfortunately, the great let-down in the writing happens in the main plot, which is full of deaths of people who we didn't really get to know and like, or who are outright unlikeable, precluding any emotional response. To add insult to injury, one death scene takes essentially 10 minutes of exposition; that's worse than most operas! While the story told by the main plot generally makes sense and provides believable motivation for the protagonists, it falls through every time the plot centers on the main antagonist. It's not just that he is one of the weaker characters in the game in terms of writing; where usually, you have a choice of whether you want to avoid confrontation, used ranged weapons, or jump right into the fight, turning points with the antagonist force you into a style that may be quite different from you do in the rest of the game (and from what you bought skills for): Those turning points always seem to drop you in a pit crawling with zombies after taking some or all of your gear away ('You're exhausted, you cannot use the grappling hook.' 'You serious, bro? Isn't that when you'd use it most?') so none of your previous experience and fighting style will do you any good. It's quite tedious.  Where Dead Island gave you a choice of 4 characters, DL gives you just one -- quite a step back. Seeing as it's a first person game, it should've been easy enough to have e.g. a female character option, at the price of one more voice actor. Incomprehensibly, they also force a background on you, and that background isn't actually in free running. Consequently, protagonist Crane stinks at parkour for the first ten levels or so. He has no moves, and he's out of breath after sprinting a few yards (or, for that matter, swinging his weapon for or fives times). You're basically paying good money to play a free running game, and then the free running stinks for the first 10 hours. Well done. (I suspect Techland and I have just grown apart; I'd like another game that's fun, and they were presumably aiming for tension and challenge -- that's the charitable interpretation, anyway. Maybe Dead Island 2 will be more my speed.)  Another big factor in why that parkour just isn't that fun are the horrid controls. I don't particularly care whether the character automatically grabs on to ledges or whether you need to press or press-and-hold a button, but DL's putting jump and hold on the same button doesn't work for me. For a start, it makes climbing down a mess. Worse than that, 'hold' also tends to imply 'pull yourself up (onto the roof etc.)' which again may not be what you want. I've wanted for Crane to hang from a pipe, only to have him pull himself up and fall down the other side. Yay? As it stands, the controls seem non-deterministic, and factoring in the lack of full health regeneration, you're summarily discouraged from trying things out or building flow -- and of course, flow is a bit of an issue in the slums you start out in anyway. (See, same as your skills don't rate for ten levels, you don't get to the beautiful old part of the city that is densely packed with buildings of similar height until you're about halfway through the game.)  The one part of the game I did rather enjoy for a while was Be The Zombie. Figures, I guess -- as the zombie, you get decent movement skills, you don't have to play the meh protagonist Crane or play the equally meh story -- et voila, fun.  As it stands, Dying Light seems a noble failure, a failure at turning Dead Island into a AAA next-gen title. On the upside, Techland seem to've published tools for modders, so if that community evolves, it may turn one of the year's Greatest Misses into a hit after all.",-1,0
273350,Evolve Stage 2,"It's been a while since I've been into an online FPS game. The co-op nature of it is a _huge_ plus. Graphics are great, and the gameplay tends to be far more exciting than not when online. Surprisingly the bots are well designed and even if you don't have a full party, you don't feel like you're hindered.  If you approach it like a Quake-style shooter, or tend to prefer that kind of gameplay, you'll find yourself frustrated. The movement mechanics, while pretty freeing, feel still at the same time limiting. Movement speed, jumping, jet fuel, it's all balanced more on the side of 'slow and methodical' rather than high-octane twitch shooting.  I don't know if that style of movement/aiming is a product of the game having to work with a controller as well as keyboard, but it's nice to have the option.   Give this game a go if you're looking for something to grab a few friends with and take on bots or other players in 4 vs 1.  ",1,0

418340,RWBY: Grimm Eclipse,"I have been a huge fan of RWBY since the red trailer and for me this game has been great. It has a similar style to L4D and Dynasty Warriors. This is where some people start to hate the game because to them it feels like a watered down version of the two with very little content. I love this game because they aren't trying to do that, they use similar gameplay styles sure but they are building from the ground up. They aren't just throwing content out because people want it they make sure the content that they do put out will be worth it and have substance. As of now before horde and JNPR update I recommend playing this game with friends. It has a rank system where you have to grind through the game numerous times to rank up, which makes the repetative gameplay more fun because you have a goal to achieve. And if you don't have anyone to play with trying to beat the game on eclipse mode is a pretty fun (and annoying) challenge you can set for yourself. I recommend this game for; 1 people who love the show, 2 people who live hack and slash games, 3 people who like playing with friends (type of game that allows you to talk with friends and don't have to focus too much), and 4 People who like to grind through leveling systems and challenges (Mainly for singelplayer but some challenges have to be done in multiplayer). Overall I love playing this game, although there is not much content right now, I like the storyline, the gameplay, connection to the community, the community of RWBY itself and the content that I know is to come.",1,0

The story is complex and filled with activities and online contains a strong story which slowly progress with you. Each little part of the game is balanced and fun to play. This is probably the only game I've ever finished the story for and I've played over 100 games.

391270,Fingerbones,"This game has no jump scares, which is excellent, has some interesting atmosphere, which is nice, and as many have said, it deals interestingly with dark subject matter, but...  It's sort of trite? And I don't just mean in the sense that it's short enough to play through in 35 minutes or less. I just mean that, even with all the endless back-and-forth wandering it entails (and yes, you'll be walking the same routes over and over throughout play) and the creepy lighting and soundscape, it's just - short and simple, with not a real shock to be had. The ending, which I won't spoil here, becomes fairly obvious as soon as you're a couple of notes in, or if you have any basic sense of how these sorts of 'deep, dark, horrid secret' games almost always work.  The character whose jottings guide you around, whom you are probably supposed to be, is of the instantly-repulsive, pretentious sort, even before you learn the full extent of his misdeeds. I'm sure the point must have been to make you dislike this person from the moment you read what they wrote, or else things would have been far more subtle.  Basically, while this game is creepy and has nice atmosphere, it does nothing new with the sort of person who is revealed to you through the pages you read. It's the same sort of see-the-end-a-mile-away, 'AND THEN YOU WAS SKELETON!' writing that we've come to expect from atmospheric little horror games which can rightly boast no jump scares, but which then at the same time do nothing to shock that you couldn't just as easily see on the evening news or any article about very bad people doing very awful things to those around them.  Maybe, as a survivor of CSA, I'm sort of jaded, but frankly, this game is almost less horror, and more simply pointing out 'See, look! People are bad and do awful things to those they're expected to protect and care for!' with some 'horror' accoutrements in the form of creepy sounds and cobweb riddled, darkened rooms, and frankly, if you don't already realise in this day and age that there are plenty of horrific people in the world who already flourish doing the sorts of things that come up over the course of Fingerbones, and don't find the thought distasteful without needing indie horror games to remind you, then I don't know what to tell you.",-1,0

316010,Magic Duels,"I've played a lot of different card games on consoles and the computer and real life. Magic has always been one of my favorites, me and my friends used to play two headed giant for hours. The new magic game seems like a limited card pool, too many mechanics and bloated effects for the game to even be playable anymore. The grind for anything worthwhile is steep, online is a joke considering everyone either pays to win or already grinded for 100 hours.  In this day and age the game just isn't free to play enough, 10 matches against the pc for 1 pack ? I think not. So sad to see such a good franchise be thrown down the p2p slope, always hoped it would come back from that but it's progressively gotten worse.  The campaign is a laughing stock as the max gold you can get is 50 from the very end, by the end of one boring campaign you can buy exactly one pack.  The game is all about the $$$ for this game developer now, maybe one day they will wake up and release something epic with a thousand or so cards with tons of deck customization options and tons of a.i vs. human modes. Until then no more cash from me greedy developers.",-1,0

234140,Mad Max,"This game is not worth 50€, but it's still worth a look.  At first it feels really nice. Great atmosphere and scenery but the story is so badly written it sometimes hurts to watch cutscenes, especially at the end. I was so disapointed by the culmination of the game that I wanted to scream at my monitor 'What the hell is going on?'  As for gameplay after 30 hours or so I was so fed up with salveging scrap,blowing up tanks, pumps and whatnot that I didn't even bother to upgrade V8. You are just forced to do the same thing over and over again. The bosses are all the same, with the same mechanics. There are a lot of variants of enemies but basicly they are just reskins. On foot combat is a poor version of Arkham Asylum and Shadow of Mordor.  Another thing is that getting 3 pieces of scrap when you need 3800 is ridiculous and is obviously a cheap way to prolong the game. After some time most of the things in this game feels lazy and rushed. There are basicly 6 things you do in this game: salvage, blow things up in camps, pull down scarecrows and sniper towers and destroy convoys (which imho is the best feature fo the game). I am not counting quests because they are just longer versions of things mentioned above. Oh, and everything takes forever to do. Hold a key to kick a door, turn valve, eat, drink, open chest, build a project in a stronghold, fill up a car and of course pick up scrap.  The game left me really, really disapinted.  So to sum things up.  Pros: - greate atmosphere, - beautiful visuals, - greate cars' design, - on wheels combat.  Cons: - story (OMG, shallow and feels rushed), - dialogs, - Max is a bloody ♥♥♥♥♥♥, - omg grinding, - wasteland encounters (those guys just talk and talk and they pretty much are useless), - on foot combat, - Max is a bloody ♥♥♥♥♥♥, - the ending.

80350,Blackwell Convergence,"This is the last game in the series I've bought (so far), and while I know there are two more after, Blackwell Convergence is the best entry! It puts the previous ones to shame in many aspects, including music, storyline and art -- especially the art. It's so lovely and expressive! The music is great and definitely affects the mood of the scenes. Heck, I spooked myself accidentally when one piece started playing.  Even the puzzles/cases are more interesting, with every character playing some important part however tiny it is. (Everyone remember the first minor character in Blackwell Legacy and his not relevant part?) Granted, some of the solutions are harder to find within this point and click game. At least, for me they were. I had to look up a walkthrough for one, because it was hard to figure out what next step to take. This might deter certain people if they can't solve it in a fairly rapid manner, but I promise you, you'll be satisfied once you solve the puzzles/cases. I know I did, and that increased my enjoyment of this game.   The mechanics have also improved, and the animation as well. It's all very fluid. Kudos to the creators for being able to dish out a bit more money for the sake of the game, because it helped. A LOT! The voice-acting's improved too -- in the first game (and possibly the second one), you could literally hear mics crashing against the actors' breath or against something else. Here, there are no audio mistakes. It all sounds professionally done.  I'd recommend to anyone interested in this series to just start with this game...BUT that's a bad move, because unfortunately this game also depends on many plot points that have been brought up in the previous two games. (Also easter eggs will feel juicier when you find them!) Part of the joy in this game is seeing all previously established details come to fruition in Blackwell Convergence. The story (if you care about this more) depends on having played the first two games, in my opinion. It makes it a stronger, and more fun, game to play.  If you just want to have fun and possibly seek out the first two after, then play this first. But it's much more satisfying to play them all in order. THAT's the best suggestion I can give you.",1,0

This is more of an FPS than an RPG, which is something I wanted from Fallout 4, but even though I don't care much for the RPG elements, the fact there are only 2 vital skillchecks, hardly ever an option of de-escalating a situation through diplomancy, and every door can be opened regardless of lockpick or science level because there's always a keycard in the exact same room, is just stupid.  The game looks awful, everything looks like polished plastic and the textures are muddy as hell, all the menus are just Fallout 3 reskins. Hair is one solid piece and facial expressions are incredibly robotic with lips often not syncing up to what's being said. The only positive graphical element is the particles, fire doesn't look great but the effect off lazers and plasma looks cool. Enemies are also balanced in a weird way, your most powerful weapon can usually take down a raider in a shot or two but then you come up against a raider that duct-taped a bit of piping to his chest and suddenly it takes 10 grenades and 4 magazines to take him down. The animations aren't exactly stellar either, everything from reloading to the cutscenes just don't look right.  The world is pretty boring, no interesting vaults to explore or unique areas. The best it gets is when you're in the middle of Boston, a few floors up looking out over the world and fighting enemies on the impromptu balconies of half destroyed buildings but even that's locked behind a few loading screens to get there. There isn't much point in exploring to begin with either considering you can just build stupidly powerful guns and that ammo never runs out if you follow the main plot.   The story isn't great, it's better than 3's which isn't exactly hard to do. You do reach a point where you're on the best of terms with each faction and they're all willing to help you out but it's made abundantly clear that after a specific point you have to side with one, it doesn't really make much sense to go beyond that point if you don't care about the story since you can jump between the factions and take as much help from them as you need.  The crafting system is okay, however the grind to find the smallest materials starts to outweight the enjoyment of building up a settlement rather quickly. I found the best way to enjoy it was to just cheat and give myself a stupid amount of building materials, although once you make your comfy settlement there isn't a whole lot to do with it, atleast nothing worth more than a curious glance over.  The game isn't very well optimised either, which is strange considering this game feels like what Fallout 3 should have been over 8 years ago, even stranger when you consider it's running on basically the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ engine. It runs well inside buildings but as soon as you step outside you can expect a ridiculous FPS drop. That's unless you fiddle with the settings to the point where the graphics suffer just so you can play the game at a bareable framerate in specific areas, despite it being fine in others.   Also shoutout to Todd's jewery for raising the price of the season pass just to cash in on the idiots who'd buy it knowing it was going up in price purely because it was 'cheaper'.   Don't buy this game. Even mods can't save it.",-1,1
388090,Five Nights at Freddy's 4,"Are you Nightmare Freddy for ready?  An amazing additional to the original quatriligy, fnaf 4 takes a fantastic approach to a whole new level, taking an original mechanic to the game and adding another. In this installment of the franchise, Scott (The creater/maker) took out the camera system and added a old mechanic of checking the doors with a light.  Pros: a good and challenging game to scare your socks off! Cons: Takes an amount of patience to succeed and leaves many questions unanswered. (Who is the purple guy etc.)  On a scale of 1-10 I'd say its a high 8 Do i recommend it? YES.",1,1
256330,WRC 4 FIA WORLD RALLY CHAMPIONSHIP,"Even though the game tends towards a simulation, this should not discourage those players that do not care for car configuration or excessively realistic difficulty. Setting the player AI to 1 (from a maximum of 8), turning off most driving aids I was able to completely dominate each special stage, winning everything. So no frustration and the fun of experiencing the different tracks and cars. If you liked the DiRT series, this game can actually be easier to win (see above setting), but that it completely up to you. The visuals may be slightly older, but on my five-year-old PC (ATi HD 5850) the game runs at around 60 FPS solid, so no worries there. Definitely get it from the bargain bin if you like rally driving games.",1,0

If ever you feel like you've played too many of the same sort of game (shooters, tower defense, what have you) then this one will provide a welcome change.  Be advised, however: the game is buggy, regularly crashes to desktop, and can drag on in the latter half. After I defeated the final boss I was unable to pick up the thingie I needed because the screen containing the thingie was all black. Fought the boss again, same issue. Deleted the game in anger. (Quitting and restarting the game and then defeating the end boss anew would have most likely made the rendering bug go away, but at the time I had no patience left.)

After slicing through some basic solidier to prove your skills you will end up in a plaza where you will meet another cyborg...'So we alredy going to have a boss fight here! after 5 minutes gameplay??

I haven't actually played it since then and I do keep meaning to get back to it but the prospect of dying and having to redo everything up to that point is kind of offputting me. Even so it was worth it just for that one day of play.  In terms of the style it is genuinely amazing and you can literally lose yourself in it for hours. The writing is mostly good but at times seems a little bit random, almost computer generated. Obviously it isn't because you see the exact same text repeatedly whenever you re-enter that area or talk to the same person. In that regard it feels like they could have written a few variants for each thing just to increase replay value. As I said, the prospect of redoing it all when I inevitably die doesn't exactly appeal to me.  Then again it has now been long enough since I last played it that I might just start from scratch anyway...  ",1,0

412140,,"NOTE: For review with screenshots, please visit  http://microfloppy.net/2016/03/26/electric-highways/   When there’s a lot of things going on in life and in work I end up playing a lot of shorter games. Luckily Steam has had an abundance of free short games lately so I haven’t had a problem finding things to play.  One game that really surprised me was Electric Highways. It was so surprisingly gorgeous and impressive (made by one developer and one composer) that I had to write a review for it.  You play a VR developer in the not-so-far future (2072) who tests his game for the last time. It is mostly a walking simulator, with some puzzle-like elements that mostly consist of finding the correct path to take.  What impresses me is how well the game fits together. Half of the experience is the soundtrack, consisting of nice, smooth synth tunes. The composer has done an amazing job creating the music to the game. Appearance-wise, the graphics are old-school but still manage to look grand and majestic. And, finally, the gameplay flows nicely without any annoying bugs, slow movement, or strange roadbumps. I had a great gaming session with this game and actually ended up playing the game a total four times in a row while just enjoying the music and the setting. It’s a very serene and calming game with a great atmosphere.   9/10 eyes ",1,0

It has a nice pet system, identifying of items, and great game play. Spent hours on this. Liked this more than D3  The game is a pretty simple to learn 1-4 player co-op RPG. There are 4 classes -- your usual caster, melee warrior, ranged specialist, and a super tank that can cross as massive pet army class [aka engineer]. The loot system is similar to your usual RPGs and in the later parts of this game, they introduce a lottery unidentified item shop keeper. As far as difficulty goes, the developers did a great job of scaling the monsters between difficulties and levels. There is no reward for playing the game at a higher difficulty, but beating the game in a higher difficulty is in itself rewarding.

391540,Undertale,"This is what gaming is all about. As you can see I have played 10 hours of this game. I got it yesterday, 4 hours yesterday 6 hours today. This is not like me at all, I am a busy guy. Today I did not study for my degree, I did not go for my daily jog, I didn't eat, I just about went to the toilet (eventually). This game is completely magical.   'RPG' is a term which barely means anything anymore, it is so broad that the label 'RPG' is no guarantee you will like a game if you have liked an 'RPG' before. So I will first make some comparisons to other games (though I should first say that in most aspects this is like no game I have ever played before). The two comparisons I would make are to the original Legend of Zelda game and to the Pokemon Game Boy games.   Now I will attempt to tell you what it is about this game that has got me so addicted (the only reason i've stopped now is because i'm on the final boss and i've failed about 6 times). First of all the art style is beautiful, simplistic yet effective, the world you inhabit in this game is strange and wonderful, at first it looks pretty dull and dreary, but there are many different places to explore which have character and individual charm.   Second of all, the characters, this is a contender for this best thing about this game; the characters in this game are some of the best i've encountered. There are some lovely characters, warm, friendly and inviting, with emotional backstories and dark secrets. There are some absolutely hilarious characters who make you laugh out loud with everything they say, many who seem mean spirited at first, but by the end they'll have you smiling and when they call your character their 'friend' you really feel an emotional attachment. There are a few who are malicious, filled with pools of dark desire. I won't give anything away specifically about any of these characters, but to name a few of my favourites to look out for: Toriel, Flowey, Bratty and Catty, Temmie, Sans and Papyrus, Megatton and that kid that follows you around. Some hilarious, some dark (or seemingly so), some sweet (or seemingly so), but all beautifully crafted and developed. You will truly learn to love or loathe them.   This brings me on to the next thing about this game; the humour. This game is genuinely hilarious, this game had me laughing more even than Stick of Truth. The humour is oddball and fast-paced, the dialogue will have you laughing out loud on many occasions. This, along with the character development is what drives the storyline.  The storyline itself is extremely touching, it is one which starts of dark and mysterious and continues in this vein, revealing slightly more of itself as it progresses. Your choices matter in this game and your choices will have you feeling genuine emotions. I felt deep regret and sympathy as well as genuine happiness.   The second contender for the best part of the game is the battle system. This is truly a work of art. I won't give anything away about how it works, but suffice it to say for a turn-based battle system, it is a lot more than simply making a choice and clicking your mouse. It does allow you to make choices, but once these are made the true beauty of the battle begins and you see the craftsmanship that went into this game. The battles can also be extremely funny.   There are a lot of secrets to uncover beneath the main storyline, though I have reached the final boss, I am sure I will replay the game to uncover more of this, there are many mysteries and so many characters to interact with that i'm sure a second playthrough is warranted.   This game is fast becoming one of my favourites, there is nothing negative I can think of to say. It is fiendishly difficult in places, charming, deep, emotional and hilarious.   One last thing: take note of the tagline 'The RPG where you don't have to destroy anyone' remember this, or you may be filled with deep, deep regret.",1,0

289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,"This game falls short. I didn't think I'd say this about Civilization VI, but it disappointed me. Before I list off all its flaws, I will mention that this game is beautiful, and the music and atmosphere is stellar - nothing less expected of a Civ game. At its core it's a worthwhile purchase; feel free to comment on any of the points I'm about to make.  1. Barbarians are ridiculous - I have a harder time staving off barbarians than I do taking on two civilizations at once. I think if you spawn near barbarians and they have horses, you should just restart your game. Save yourself the hassle - you'll lose a lot of early game pressure building units to take them out.   2. Victories come as a surprise. Twice now I've won a cultural victory without wanting to. I was wanting a scientific win or domination; ploughing through Rome and China only to see Cultural victory screens. Very disappointing. From now on I'll disable cultural and religious wins.   3. The government slots are so messy once you reach the mid-game. It takes eons to reach the next row of government - Civlilzation V did it better with the talent trees. You're given very limited slots and they're all rather 'meh'. Some are far too powerful not to use, so you're stuck with all this clutter.  4. Religion in this game is absolutely ridiculous. Leaders repeatedly break their promises not to convert your cities mere turns after saying they won't, and if you go to war with them your warmonger penalty remains the same as it would if they had not have broken their promise. Just hope that you have enough faith to birth Inquisitors like you're Spanish.  5. The AI is shocking. I already know the personalities of all the leaders. China will denounce me on turn 1 if it gets a sniff that I want to build a wonder in my life time. Denunciations flow in at the speed of sound if you sneeze the wrong way; Civilization V was so much more freeing and surprising.   In short, playing this offline will be garbage. You'll want to play with your friends if they can afford the price tag.

266210,One Way Heroics,"=HEADS UP= I had a review before this one about the game being good. This stays of course but i had to clarify some points and fix this old messy review that i made before.  =INFO ABOUT THE REVIEW= 1. My reviews tend to be a bit longer. If that is the case please be patient and read everything. 2. This review is about my point of view and opinion. [If you disagree on a certain point or want to correct me: Be reasonable or i will ignore your comment.] 3. If you want to try to change my opinion with arguments that make no sense in any way then please do not comment at all.  =REVIEW= Now what can i say about this game? That it is worth the money. It is a small game with only one purpose for you. Go forth and kill stuff. But there is a twist to it. The World is ending and you are the legendary hero to venture out and try to get ahead of what is coming after you to kill you. And what is that right behind you? Pure Darkness.  This game leads in a certain direction and that one is Right. You go as far as you can get to meet at the end the Bad guy to stop the End of the World. But that is not an easy task. Even though this game is semi roguelike you wont have that much trouble with it like other roguelike games. Over the time of you playing you will die. But everytime you can transfer items into a little box that is between the dimensions. And as soon as you visit a new world you can decide if you want to take it with you or not. This makes the game a bit more enjoyable and easier for you. But in the end it depends on you how it ends.  The game brings you into a randomly generated world. Here will the Adventure begin and here you can do whatever you want. Go on and kill some bad guys. You are the Hero. Go into the Taverns and buy gear and let the people help you. Or just kill them and their guards. That is right. You are allowed to do everything you want. Kill, destroy and so on and so forth. But there is a nice twist to it. If you are the great Hero you are able to find people that want to help you defeating the bad guy. And since everyone trusts you they will not attack you when seeing you. If you do attack other people though the game will punish you. The word goes around very fast and in other inns or taverns the guards will recognize you for what you did and will try to kill you. But not only the guards will turn aggressive but also the other people.  So it is up to you what will happen in the game. At the very end it is the bad guy who you want to kill. But it depends on you how easy or hard this may be.",1,0

550,Left 4 Dead 2,"Left 4 Dead 2 is a four player co-op action horror game that comes from Valve. It takes place during a zombie invasion and you and your friends have to fight your way through the hordes of undead in order to reach safety.  You play one of four characters based on known horror stereotypes. The Veteran is a former soldier, now he's old and tired but don't think he lost skills cause of that. The Punk is a biker and a criminal. He's a bad-♥♥♥ that can't really take the situation serious. The Nerd is an unlucky desk jockey that used to spend his days either coding or playing games. Now he has to use his brain and skills to survive. The Expert spent all her time watching zombie flicks, reading zombie books, playing zombie games and discussing zombies online. When the zombie outbreak took place her otherwise useless knowledge made her an expert.  You can play through four different scenarios, called movies, with five maps each where the objective is to reach safety. You have to work together with your friends to find strategies in order for you all to survive. To give you an unique experience it uses your performance to tailor how often you get attacked and the ferocity of them in order for you to be challenged without being overwhelmed.  The game also offers a Versus Mode where you and your friends can compete four-against-four, changing between playing the team of survivors and playing specialized zombie-monsters. The Hunter is a fast and agile type that can jump high and far. You attack by tackling the other opposite team and clawing them to death. The Smoker is a sniper type of monster that uses it's tongue to yank away unsuspected players. The Boomer spews out a substance that attracts others of the enemies position. It's also a human bomb that explodes upon death, injuring everything close. The Charger is basically a berserker. It charges the enemy, killing everything in it's way and flings everyone else around with a heavy blow. The Spitter is a range type that spits acid. The Jockey latches on to the back of the other teams members and takes over.  In Survival Mode you, and your friends of course, are truly tested to see how long you can stand against the hordes of zombies that are thrown at you.",1,0

261760,Lichdom: Battlemage,"An intense FPSesque combat game with a fantasy setting. Has more similarity to such ancient Doom era (and engine) games Heretic and Hexen, and with the Diablo series than it does with an RPG. Level design is very aesthetically pleasing, but linear with a few explorative branches for loot and or extra challenges. The voice actors are great and plotline is good, but not great and does feel as though it ends abruptly in such a way to lead into a sequel to wrap things up. The combat and spell crafting are what makes the game rather enjoyable and worth experiencing. Great for someone looking for intense magical combat rather than a deeply immersive role-playing experience.  The combat is straightforward with no resource management (no ammo/mana other than a recharging shield) and relies blocking and teleporting for defense and for offense switching between three Sigils (like elements) each with a single target, a targeted area of effect, and a self radiating nova (from a good block or charged teleport). The basic projectile attack can be crafted with three different shapes, one for the basic shot that has a small amount of auto-aim, one for a lobbed bomb that explodes into smaller bursts for a semi-AoE, and a shorter ranged spraying ray. Similarly the Area power can be crafted into three shapes, a basic AoE, a radiating pool that hits anything that passes into it, and an exploding trap. Each spell is crafted with Augments onto the Shapes that dictate not only bonuses, but also the spell's attunement to either Damage, Control, or Mastery. Damage is self explanatory, and Control is pretty standard hold/paralyze effect, but Mastery is a bit more complex working often as a debuff, but always as a way to build up extra potential critical damage. Hit a target with a control attuned spell to lock it down, then a mastery spell to increase the critical damage, and finally a charged damage spell for 100% critical chance and watch the fireworks. The basic elemental Sigils (Fire, Ice, Lightning, and Kinetic) each influence the shape of the spell in subtle ways to give many options for building together various combos of spells that work well together, and it can be fun (though sometimes a bit daunting) to sort out which of the many permutations work best for you. The more advanced Sigils (Corruption, Delirium, Necromancy, and Phase) start behaving a bit more radically different in how they work. Even your character's shield (this games equivalent for hit points) is craftable with various shapes to help tailor your combat tactics ranging from fewer teleport blinks but more hit points for the tank playstyle to less hit points and unlimited blinks for more active and mobile dodger playstyle.  The crafting loot is one of the places where the game takes after the likes of Diablo, with the loot drops from mobs being these building blocks of Shapes and Augments used to craft spells, with the level of the loot as well as its colored rarity dictating how powerful of a spell you can end up crafting with it. Another is the bad guys can spawn with the occasional affix that grants it some perks like knockdown or faster attacks, radiating damage, or even making fellows invulnerable.",1,0
248390,Craft The World,"[edit] How sweet, they introduced rats in the latest update, and the solution to get rid of rats via paid DLC. Thanks devs, thats a real insentive to keep playing this game :(    After spending a long time playing Minecraft and Terraria, I started looking for a new game with similar playing experience and that would hook me in just like those ones. Craft The World seemed to do just that, and once I started playing I found myself sucked in and spending long hours immersed, at least until I completed the first world.  The game is very enjoyable to play, easy and intuitive to learn. It’s fun to command around your army of cute little dumb dwarfs. And dumb they are, sometimes amusing you with their complete goofiness and sometimes testing your patience to the limit, as they so often seem to refuse collaboration. They have a persistent tendency of being in the wrong place. Command your dwarfs to build something, and you can be sure all other idle dwarfs will run to that same spot and stand there doing nothing, just hampering the dwarf who is actually trying to do the building. Relax your attention for a moment, and the dwarves may wander off getting lost into caves or falling down to their deaths into pits full of critters.  All this fun will last you through the first world though, as you will have to start from scratch once you beat the first world and start the second one. All the long hours you spent grinding through the tech tree, collecting resources, upgrading and training your dwarfs will all be lost once you make it through the portal to the next world.  This is a major drawback of this game, as it gives you little reason to keep on playing after the first world. It’s frustrating to have to start over, and not being able to keep your dwarves and tech upgrades. I don’t mind arriving at a new world to build and explore, but starting everything all over from point zero with one dwarf and no tech was enough for me to put the game down for good.  Another part of the game mechanics that makes little sense is the huge tech tree you have to work through in order to get access to better equipment. Many of the items you are forced to craft in order to advance are completely useless (mirrors, decorative items, columns, statues, gargoyles...). These useless items should not be mandatory.  It would also be nice to be able to assign individual tasks to a dwarf or group of dwarves, as the current game only allows tasks to be assigned collectively. This task assignment is not always efficient – sometimes a dwarf standing right next to a assigned task will do nothing while another dwarf will come from far away to complete that task.  I can say without any doubt that I enjoyed playing this game and that the 30 hours+ spent to finish the first world were worth the money I paid for it, but I wish there had been a way to continue the game without losing everything I conquered.  Maybe the developers will correct these issues in a future update, as it has been a major source of complaint among players.",-1,0

338310,Warden: Melody of the Undergrowth,"This is a half-recomendation.  The game is, at its heart, good, however it less than unpolished, it is downright rough in areas. Some mechanics are difficult to control to the point of irritation and the game will kill you a number of times because of faults with the physics engine whereby you will maintain your momentum when you jump, so if you start sliding off something the traditional method of jumping to get a better foothold won't work. This can also throw off your jumps if you land somewhere that gives you this momentum and jump before realising that you're flying uncontrollably off course.  However, despite those faults, the game IS still playable and I am confident they can be patched and fixed at a later date.  Another qualm is that despite the narrative woes the main character goes through at the beginning of the game he is quite content to smile like a goof throughout a lot of it, making it difficult to get invested in what is going on.  HOWEVER... having said all of that I still recomend the game. There is some very good art direction going on here, and some of the models really impressed me. The gameplay, though rough, is pretty solid and thus-far is about the same level of challenge you would get from Ocarina of Time or Majora's Mask.  The developers also seem to be rather proud of the lore they have given to this world, as one of the collectibles in the game are lore scrolls that give brief explainations of the world, and the things you will find in it, and they are kept in a dedicated lore tab. It is not a large gesture but it does a lot to reassure me of how much the devs care about the game.  The game is at its best when nobody is talking and you are let loose to explore an atmospheric area. There is plenty of evocative map design going on here and I will be interested to discover more of it going forwards. I hope the developers keep working on this game post-launch to smooth out the edges (and honestly, those are edges that should have been smoothed before release just fyi, lads).",1,0
391540,Undertale,"I picked up Undertale in the Christmas Steam sale, so I got aboard the Untertale train pretty late. I had managed to avoid spoilers, so I was playing through it blind, but most of the way through my first playthrough of this game, I have to say I thought the game was kind of overhyped.  Sure, the writing was pretty funny at times, and the music was good, and the schtick of an RPG where you could talk your way through everything instead of killing was different. But I didnt get the story, and some of the boss fights were just tedious, to the point where I was pretty close to just quitting instead of continuing to slog through dying over and over and over on the final boss. When I finally got past him to the end of the game, it was with more of a sense of a grand FINALLY! than a grand finale.   But then, without putting spoilers in this review, lets just say that at that point, the pieces of the story that I had been missing finally clicked into place, and my appreciation of the narrative blossomed exponentially.   I no longer think this game is overhyped; in fact, I don't think it has gotten nearly as much attention as it deserves.  Since then, I have played through the entire thing, start to finish, two more times (something I have never wanted to do for any other RPG, at least without a couple years in between, and certainly not back-to-back-to-back playthroughs). Each time, I have gleaned more hidden gems of absolutely marvelous storytelling (there is a metric buttload of secrets all over the place.) The dialog and events are by turns charmingly funny and incredibly, heart-wrenchingly sad; no game has ever made me laugh OR cry as much as this one has. I can't recommend it highly enough.",1,0

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"I don't have a ridiculous amount of hours in this game, but let me tell ya, I don't usually do these reviews unless the game is REALLY special to me, or to warn someone of what they're getting into before dumping cash into a game that isn't worth it.  To be honest as I bought the game my initial thought was the latter. I thought this was just some little game with a sharp learning curve which makes it difficult for most to beat in under an hour. I thought I would see everything in the game in under two hours and I'd be able to return it and get my $15 back to buy a more worthwile game.  Apparently this was not the case....  I'm gonna try to keep this short by simply listing some Pros and Cons:  PROS: - Hard but fair. If you were interested in this game because you want a challenge, this is for you. The gameplay is ALOT deeper than it seems. - Sick and twisted atmosphere. Edmund McMillen officially has the most F***ED UP mind for creating this game.. and i LOVE it. 'Yay Cancer!'? who says that?? - Secrets. If you like secrets, this game gives absolutely NO shortage of secrets. I've played for over 40 hours and I'm nowhere near close to finding everything in the game - Multiple endings. This is in no way a 'story driven' game, but I will say if you think you've beaten the game, KEEP PLAYING. the End Credits only mean you've unlocked MORE of the game, whether it be new power ups, new bosses and enemies, or new level types. There will ALWAYS be something new and you'll never really be done with the game. - Multiple characters with different stats and special perks. - Power ups do more than just 'power you up'. As you play the game and collect powers you're character will become more and more unrecognizable, from hilarious to utterly gross to nightmare-inducing and terrifying.  CONS: - Only problem I truly have about this game, is I wish it gave more info on what the power-ups do. Everything is intentionally vague and i guess it's part of the charm and learning curve of the game, but you can have all of these power-ups equipped at once and won't know what half of them actually do.

231740,Knights of Pen and Paper +1,"Knights of Pen and Paper was a IOS and Android game that could rival Angry birds, Candy Crush saga and....Flappy bird??. But since Knights of pen and paper was released on PC it has become even bigger than its compedators, I have hundreds of hours clocked on the IOS version of this game and have loved every single moment of it. The PC Version has increased features, some added monsters, adventures and etc and will keep you playing for hours.  Knights of Pen and Paper is as the title suggests a pen and paper kind of game like Dungeons of dragons, where you roll a dice and depending on the number you can get good or bad results. For example, ingame you are camping in the woods and you have to get between 5 and 10 in order for your group to rest without being attacked, if you get lower than 5 and 20 your group will be attacked by an enemy equal to your Level. When you travel you roll the dice and same as before you will either get good or bad results.   The characters in this game range from a Jock, A Rocker, Teen girl, Alien, Little brother, Grandma, and many more, each character has a different ability that will make you think if thats the right character for a class. Another example would be the Grandma who has extra Threat so if the gradma was a Warrior she would be the Tank of the group being that the monsters will attack her more than any of her group. The Story ingame is completely up to you, you make choices and the characters follow them. Each character type has their own funny quirks and quips like the little brother shouting 'PICK ME PICK ME PICK ME' when going into battle or the Jock character just being an ♥♥♥.  10/10 must Buy ;3",1,0

The story starts off very quickly, as soon as you launch the game, i'm not sure if there are mutiple paths in the game to take, as I had just beaten it a momment ago.

Worse, the tutorial, which beginners like me must cling to is an unmitigating mess.The instruction sprawl out ot their box and obscure what they are telling you to do.So there are then boxes to try and shift with provinces getting picked up and cluttered in with it.Meanwhile the instructions chug on even though you aren't sure you are in the right country any more let alone which stack to merge.I have a reasonable knowledge of German geography in the 17th century but a lot of the time I wouldn't have a clue where I was supposed to be,or how to do what I was supposed to be doing and the instructions were most likely obscuring it any way..I understand it's complex stuff and some brain is required to get to understand a clever game but the tutorial is a mess and the instructions construed poorly. The music is splendid , the game looks very good,and even a nit picker like me could not find anything wrong historically save the missing French. Ok,why the thumbs down? I want to play this game,and wasn't cheap either but I really can not be bothered wading through the awful tutorial again now......perhaps another day....a bit sad..",-1,1

238430,Contagion,"Really good game for those of you who like zombies.  Great Survivor vs Survivor action, aswell as several Co-op modes vs both AI and Player Zombies.  Hunted - S vs S based mode with Player Zombies aswell. You spawn in a random location on the map, and your objective is to stay alive the longest. Scavenge the abandoned houses along the way, but beware - hitting B as a human brings up your phone, and you and other players can see who is close aswell as get a buzzing noise when hitting the trigger. If you die you will respawn as a zombie and your only task is to bring down the remaining survivors. Last survivor alive wins the round.  Escape - Band together with friends and strangers in this Survivor vs AI / PC zombies. Your phone will let you know what objective you need to accomplish and your main goal is to escape from the map. Weapons, ammo and items will be found along the way. Make sure you check every corner as they are sometimes hidden or you need to progress further to unlock the areas they are in.  Extraction - Survivor vs AI / PC zombies where your goal is to follow the GPS on your map and find survivors held up in houses. Once you reach a holdout point, vast amounts of zombies will begin spawning, so share your ammo and your weapons with your friends, as each member of your team that gets killed will come back as one of the ravenous corpses coming to eat you. Round ends when all survivor packs have been extracted, or the zombies kill either all Player survivors or NPC survivors in a pack.  Panic (Objective) - The P:O mode was taken from the spiritual prequel Zombie Panic! Source, another game worth picking up as it's free, and features a strictly PS vs PZ combat zone, where the survivors need to complete the objectives much like in Escape.  Panic (Classic) The original game mode from ZP!S which just like the Objective mode features only player combat. Survive the zombie rush. Zombies have limited lives and the first player to turn becomes the strong Riot Zombie.  Happy hunting and good luck surviving!",1,0

The graphics are acceptable and the overall game is not bad, but it is not in the 'good' or 'great' league either - it is just o.k. The game was not captivating and enjoyable enough to make it something I was eager to play. Rather it was just an o.k. experience. I think this game would have been good when it was originally released, but now it is not up to scratch. I think it tries too hard to be original instead of focusing on the quality of the gameplay.

220240,Far Cry® 3,"This game is boring. It has a big world filled with scripts and nameless, faceless characters. The story and transformation of the MC is pathetic, as he goes from 0 to a one man army of destruction unknown how (tribal magic). The different PoI are a fair distance apart and the map is a living nightmare. Cudos that every tower is unique, but the one thing that can give strategic advantage to someone is, well... not ♥♥♥♥ing guarded! Want to play stealthy? Tough choice. Only from a certain point on the stealthy approach becomes viable and only to an extent. The rest is shooting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but if that is the point - OK. There are 2 characters that are worth it in this game and those two are Bambi and Sam. Vaas is OK, but too little interaction with him. Also, EXP progression isn't worth ♥♥♥♥, I got all my skills unlocked and had some points left. Without all side missions to boot. The money aren't an issue either, just there to tease you for actually doing something. Once you get a rifle with a scope and silencer - there, it is done. Nobody can stop you. Not to mention that knife strikes do more damage than a sniper rifle. Oh, did I mention the repetative lines of ALL THE NPCs? It is a nightmare 10 hours in the game. When you stalk a base? 'I should have used a rubber' When you conquer a base all alone? The Rakyat are all like 'It's all me'. Why does Vaas have a sister? Tribal boobs and exotic butt, that's why! 'She is a great warrior' my ♥♥♥, from what I saw she only teased the Rakyat into doing something. The ending(s) are just as STUPID as the rest. Be all tribal or not be all tribal. The strong female character breaking up for the MC? Why not, it's not like they are sexist or anything. This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Waste of time. First and probably last Far Cry game I am going to play.

And that's really the only qualm I had (among other vastly smaller nitpicks), will you be able to get the marble to it's ultimate destination?  With plenty of levels, appealing visuals, monumental design, and tons of customization for the marble Marble Mountain is a game worth picking up.",1,0

319630,Life is Strange™,"This game heavily relies on atmosphere and character colour/drama, as such you will be treated to many long unskipable cut-scenes with accompanied (mostly acoustic guitar) music. These happen very frequent and give the game a strong film/TV feel. Due to this, your enjoyment of the game will be dictated by your enjoyment of the story elements and interest in the characters. Play episode 1 for free to judge if they match your taste.  My thoughts? Yeah, it's a fairly good P&amp;C game. The rewind mechanic mostly functions as a puzzle solving tool, but one can also use it to change any choice made in-game, thus enabling you to experience all the immediate resulting variations of your choices without requiring multiple playthroughs; but rewind does not show long-term results (if any exist).  The puzzles are very easy and mostly serve as in-game 'speed bumps' to slow progress; in fact many puzzle solutions only become available once you hit a mandatory fail-state, forcing you to use your rewind mechanic. The game designed the choice system well and your decisions have a varying level of impact on the NPC interactions, however don't expect an ability to make story driven choices as there is really only one track of story to follow. Nevertheless the dialog options do add colour to the tale.",1,0

You can read other reviews to see the particulars of why this game is so underwhelming. It truly feels like a $14.99 DLC as a concept, it feels unfinished. I am really disappointed in this game and I refuse to pay another $30.00 in DLC to get a truly worthwhile game.

394230,Battleborn,"Because I've invested thousands of hours into the Borderlands franchise (man, that franchise definitely has re-playability) I had really high expectations for this game and it met a lot of them: great graphics, a good variety of playable characters, variety available in the helix tree (or whatever it's called) BUT, I quit playing it after 2 weeks because of several reasons: 1)it sucked having to wait so long to get a team and often, I'd only end up with one, and occasionally 2, other people. 2) it didn't match people by skill level very well 3)It got boring playing the same areas over and over - and over and over. Occasionally the lag from so much going on the screen made it stupidly impossible to fight, especially when WATER was whooshing everywhere! But, the thing that probably annoys me the most is that it's on sale this week for $29.99. I'm not sure I can even see myself playing it again (until some distant future date when I might be bored to death) and because of that, I feel like I threw away nearly 100 bucks, And now they have the balls to charge for fancier skins (that don't add any features) and taunts?!? If they weren't just cosmetic (visually/audibly) it might be worth investing some REAL cash (above and beyond the money I already feel like I threw away), but NO.",-1,0

The story falls flat, only hitting a few interesting notes in the whole 8-hour experience. The gameplay is simplistic and repetitive, and every time a computer screen said 'INSUFFICIENT POWER' or 'PLEASE INSERT 3 THINGS' I'd roll my eyes and go pixel-hunting again.   To the game's credit, the visual and audio design is superb, selling the atmosphere and the scares very well. The world the game builds is an interesting one, albeit lacking in the detail I so badly wanted it to have. I was intrigued, but ultimately let down.  I feel like what's here in this game was maybe half or a third of what I had hoped it would be, stretched out over three times as much actual playtime as it warranted.

269810,Spate,"A very interesting an artfully made game, the visuals are fantastic and storyline is good. The absinth mechanic is cool, as it changes the gameplay and distorts your vision.  As you can see from my play time, this is a short game, so if that is a dealbreaker, stear clear. If the game is on sale and you are hungry for a unique and beautiful game, give Spate a shot. While the visuals are entrancing, the gameplay is bland, and you'll find yourself guzzling absinth while you run through the game. There are two endings, but you have to play through the game again to see both, or look up the ending you missed.",1,0

410110,12 is Better Than 6,"It's a decent game - yes it's a Hotline Miami-a-like. I certainly wouldn't say clone, enough effort has gone in, it's just in the same genre. If you can pick it up cheap I would - it's challenging, but when you die it's your fault not the controls. One downside is that it feels like 'wild west hat simulator' sometimes - you can't tell the difference between a live guy and a dead guy because they both just look like hats.They should proabably change the colour on dead enemies. I'd like an option to zoom out slightly, almost like an FOV slider, without breaking the game. You can press a button but sometimes you'll get killed by a hat that's barely on screen and therefore 12 feet in front of you.  Music is good (not exactly thematic but still) and art style is interesting if nothing else. A little colour wouldn't hurt! As I said it's challenging, I haven't even completed the first act (of 3 I believe) in an hour so I'm happy with the pricing. If there's ever an update then some voice acting would go a long way for immersion too.  I've said a lot negative, but I'd buy it again having played it. If you like HM buy it.",1,0

474820,,"A short, surreal point-and-click game. Even considering its criminally short length, it is frustrating because it's very difficult to discover what you are supposed to do. I was hoping from the images and description that this would be something like Samorost, but to draw such a comparison would be a huge disservice to that game. You explore an area with your mouse cursor, scrolling around clicking stuff and hoping it progresses you somehow. Repeat a few times and the game is over. As I finished it, I couldn't believe what I had completed was not just an introductory level.  The artwork is nice, reminds me of old windows stuff (in a good way) but there really isn't very much of it. If it weren't for the unfathomable 'puzzles' you could complete this in a couple of minutes. I can't believe anyone has got the trading cards for this game without just idling it. Charging money for it is very cheeky, and even for less than a pound it's really not worth it. There are lots of free games on Steam, and you'd do better with almost any one of them.  If this is meaningful, I don't understand it, and whatever its meaning is must be pretty darned brief.",-1,0

Was really excited for D3 and grinded for 70+ hours to not even get to hell when it first came out and was furious that couldn't use any of the drops amd having to buy gear on Auction House ever other level (gun to head) and just didn't really find the experience enjoyable(cut scenes were cool). Torchlight was on sale and bought it with low expectations to be honest. 20$ instead of 60$ for D3.  Loved it, played it all the way through on two charectors and really enjoyed the experience and the WOW factor of what gear is going to drop next. It truly felt like the next step after D2. Played for 67 hours (i thought more....). I actually really enjoyed the artistic difference in this game. Its less dark and more happy kill evil monsters looking. Felt fun and enjoyable all the way through never really felt like grinding.  Only Con- End game doesn't really exist, its a play through and basically be done.  Hope this helps and hope you enjoy the game. Andy",1,0

Playing through some of the parts I even found myself saying 'This feels like I'm playing the other Tomb Raider games'. Its fast paced, you will get stuck (and get fustrated).

The only shortcoming whatsoever in this installment of the Elder Scrolls series, is the hit-miss ratio battle system, which can easily be fixed with a simple command code, the only one you should ever use if you wish to fully enjoy this masterpiece if a game.",1,0

231430,Company of Heroes 2,"Finally! we have a sequel to the critically accalamed Company of Heroes Series. The first games received many awards and was dubbed the best RTS of all time. From what I have played, Company of Heroes 2 feels and looks like it is a fitting sequel. The team at Relic Studios has done it again, from beautiful graphics, how they implemented the 'True Sight' system fog of war, your infantry squads being able to climb over fences, stone walls and many other types of cover, the meticulous use of the need for a good strategy and the use of the weather, like blizzerds, snow on the ground to slow troop movements and the need to keep your troops from freezing. The game focuses on the Easter Front of World War 2, you can play as the hard hitting and gritty Russians and their infamous penal battalions, or the strategic and cunning Germans with their dangerous Panzer tanks. Over all I give this game an 8 1/2 out of 10. Congratulations to Relic on producing another great game!",1,0

221830,The Book of Unwritten Tales: The Critter Chronicles,The first game was fun. But this game is just that same joke all over again and it is extremely boring. The first game had polished cutscenes but this one doesn't. The voice acting is really annoying .The voices are also very loud while the background score is almost non-existant. The worst part is the terrible logic for solving the puzzles. It is just crazy the amount of pixel/object hunting and object combining permutations you have to do to solve a puzzle. An overall boring and frustrating experience. The selling point of the first game was it's wacky humor and that has dried up and this is just a grind. If you still want some cheap laughs and want to know how the prequel story that led to Nate and Critter teaming up then just play with a walkthrough. That's what I did right after chapter 2.,-1,0

255370,KickBeat Steam Edition,"This is just a ton of fun, and I don't know how I had never heard of it. KickBeat is a DDR-style rhythm game with a holistic sensibility about the beat, jumping among drums, guitar, and vocals as they become prominent in the song. It doesn't feel like you're playing the drums with your keyboard; it feels like you're conducting the whole song. The mapping of the built-in songs is precise and joyful. The songs themselves are way more industrial-metal than I usually prefer, but in this game they work perfectly, and you'll agree with me even if it's not your genre.  Apart from gameplay, one thing that really stands out is the unexpectedly hilarious writing of the cutscenes. Honest belly laughs. It's baffling how writers with such good instincts could name their game KickBeat, possibly the most forgettable name for a video game I can think of, right up there with the equally underappreciated Defender's Quest.  The upper difficulty levels sometimes require three simultaneous button presses, and some keyboards -- including both of mine -- have an issue with 'ghosting' that prevents them from registering all three. This is not a game bug, it's a hardware bug, but it's still something to be aware of before you buy. The lower difficulty levels are still plenty satisfying and offer lots of replayability.  Full-throated recommendation. This game deserved press and didn't get it.",1,0

270170,Depression Quest,"Depression Quest is a well written interactive text game. An unnamed male protagionist, whom you play as, suffers from depression. He finds it hard to muster up the motivation to do anything and hates himself for it. There are many nights where he can't fall asleep because of the insecurities that plauge his mind.  This is also represented very well with the filter that is put on the photography that acompanies the text. There is text at the bottom on most pages that helps monitor how severe the character's state of depression is. The player has multiple opertunities to chose different kinds of treatment or to ignore it all together.  The protagionist has multiple friends and how you choose to socalize with them affect the ending and the character's overall mood. The parts with the protagionist's girlfriend, Alex, got to me the most.  Most of my closest childhood friends suffer from depression and it really hit home for me to play this story out. When people think of depression, they think of sadness. What people really feel is exhaustion and a lack of motivation accompanied by self hatred for this lack of energy. This is one of the points Depression Quest drives home the most.  Even if it doesn't sound interesting, I never felt uninterested. It took me an hour and a half to complete it the first time and even in parts where I thought it was hard to continue, that I wanted to put the game down, it was never in disinterest. This game is beautiful and I would encourage anyone who likes interactive text to give this one a chance. It is, afterall, free.

2600,Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines,"Pros:  1. This game has tons of options for character cutomization. Different vampire clans, each with their own advantages/disadvantages make each playthrough unique. 2. Many different dialogue options. Conversations with characters can go different ways depending on what you choose. 3. Interesting and engaging storyline.  Cons: 1. Know that this game has MANY bugs. It took me multiple tries to get it to work. First, there was an issue with space, then its display settings had to be changed, then it couldn't connect to steam etc etc. It's a pain and takes a while to work them all out, but so many people experience it that you can find the solution easily. 2. The character outfits are sort of glitchy. I doubt this will bother some but I noticed it with certain clothing options. 3. I didn't really care for the more action-oriented aspects of the game. I ended up just trying to get through combat areas quickly so I could get back to the story.  This game is a lot of fun and I would definitely recommend it. However, you have to be willing to go through the process of weeding out the bugs. Like I said, there are a lot of them, but the game is worth it.",1,0

258970,Gauntlet™ ,"I have to agree with the other points straight away with regards to the game becoming a grind to get any real upgrades that aren't that effective anyway. I did enjoy playing it with a few friends but it becomes rather tedious on single player, not to mention insanely hard at times with very little reward. I would recommend it if it's at a really low price but otherwise it's too expensive for a repetitive game that you'll have to put hours into for very little difference.",-1,0

7940,Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare,"9/10  As with all CoD games the campaign can pretty much be disregarded although there are a few memorable missions there were genuinely enjoyable to play. And a final challenge mission as a reward for sitting out the campaign. The gamplay is smooth and very easy to get aquainted with. As with all CoD games it all about Multiplayer. The online experience provided on this game is still very high, servers are active and there are always modded alternatives to vanilla servers. Wide selection of guns and relatively balanced perks.  In my opinion all games in the CoD franchise have been vastly inferior and have been progressively getting worse since Activision realised how big of a success this game was. At is current price even without discounts it's definitely worth the money and time to play.",1,0

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"I have a love hate relationship with this game. It's glitchy as hell, the character models are bland, plastic feeling, and sometimes their voices change mid conversation or just end a conversation with [...]. Additionally, the background is desolate with pretty much everything trying to kill you.   But there's something about the shear immersion of the game that makes it enjoyable to play. Maybe it's just walking through the nuclear wasteland and meeting the post apocalyptic dark world and it's inhabitants. Or modifying, maintaining, and finding a colossal arsenal of weapons and clothing. Or just plain killing everything and everyone... I have no idea.  I can play this game hours on end and there is easily 100+ hours of game play (not counting DLC or its replay-ability). Moreover, I believe FO:NV currently has the most lines of dialogue in the gaming world. But it's just hard for me to want to play this game. Final rating~ 7/10",1,0

245730,Flashback,"Aaahh, a game from the dark ages, where 640kb was more than enough RAM, the CPU ran at 25(50) or 33(66) MHz depending on whether the turbo button was activated or not  and the graphics had 256 different colours.  This game also reminds me about the fabolus music score, originaly tracked in MOD by Audiomonster (aka Raphaël Gesqua)  Flashback was originaly an old dos game, published in 1992 by Delphine Soft./US Gold. But VectorCell made a remake of it in 2013 (published by UbiSoft)   So, the main genre of this old game is action. If anyone mentions the term  2D platformer from the 90's, to me immediately come to mind the following  three titles: Prince of Persia, Another World and Flashback.  The game is situated into the 22nd century, when a scientist Conrad B. Hart,  finds strange machinations with human DNA in a IEG (former United Nations) -  a company that rules the whole world. Each power is based on a herd of docile  sheep that go to where it should be and whoever falls outside of this instrument  becomes a little uncomfortable and the problem affected even our otherwise very  sympathetic scientist, who is also the hero of this game. To fight with enemies you  use your gun, but you can also use objects from the environment, such as stones,  which you can use to hurt your enemies.  All in all, great game, great remake, great timewaster (as all games), but i might be  a bit over nostalgic about this game (it was my youth) ",1,0

But for as your review that i lost interest in after the first chapter of a 1000 words, i think your being way to critical on the game itself and the devs, I do remember seeing something in the news about a lad buying a leaked copy of this game for a sum of like 1300 or 1500 bucks, and he ruined the game by saying he made it to the center of the game, blah blah then i also remember the devs pushing back the release date on this game to do a patch cuz of that lad.

32150,Everyday Genius: SquareLogic,"It costs me a mere £3.99, and let me tell you, it's bang for your buck! In the first world alone, they offer near to 800 unique puzzles after clearing the initial 13, certified to be solved without any guesswork. I haven't played the whole game yet, but I see about 5 other worlds on the map, so that makes me estimate that I'll be getting about 4000 puzzles by the end of it all! I would describe the gameplay as a unique twist on sudoku, making it a bit more maths-y. The maths, however, is so basic and instantaneous in the mind of any average person that it makes for fun and addictive puzzle-solving gameplay!

237930,Transistor,"Rating: 8/10  Transistor has one of the most unique combat systems of any game I've played. It is both a combination of real time action combined with turned based strategy. What makes this interesting is that you can activate turned based combat at any time, but it comes at a big cost. After you execute a 'turn', it is put on a cooldown where most (or all) of your abilities become unavailable for a short time. This makes you very vulnerable to the enemy and creates a very interesting risk/reward type combat system. Do you fight in realtime and suffer from slow attack swings? Or do you take a 'turn' getting off those attacks for free, but suffer a large and vulnerable downtime?  Additionally, any ability can be 'equipped' to any other ability to modify how it works. Your fast bolt attack can be 'equipped' to another attack to make it shoot faster for instance. This gives so many unique combinations of attacks that it's quite overwhelming at first. This dynamic setting of attacks is really rewarding as it feels like your attacks are unique to you. And it allows for a vast amount of different playstyles which keeps combat fresh. You can switch from a heavy hitting melee to a long range mage to a stealthy backstabbing rogue.  But that's not all Transistor has to offer. The backgrounds are beautiful, the voice acting is great, the atmosphere is amazing, the artstyle is sublime, and the story really brings it all together. The mystery of it all keeps you craving for more to make it a true beautiful work of art.",1,0

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"I've only progressed through about 5 of the main story missions.   It's a fun game, confusing if you are unfamiliar with the MGS series.   This timeline   [metalgeartimeline.com]  is a nice read for getting the jist of the story line.   The gameplay is fun, its interesting using your recovery system to shoot people into the sky. I often mess up the controls and end up killing instead of incapacitating the AI which seems to give up searching for a player faster than most stealth games.   As many have mentioned, you can: Go sneaky beaky like, or Go in guns blazing and killing everyone and their mother because you messed up at that one part and broke your silencer on the first shot and now you've gotta kill the guard.   The environments, specifically the rest of the map other than the outposts and bases is, for me, a little bit depressing. It's a desert, sure. There's probably not a whole hell of a lot in there, but there is no reason for you to get on your horse and ride to another side OP or a main mission. I often find myself just calling in a helo and getting extracted so I can redeploy closer to my mission of choice.  One thing I stumbled across is a means of fast travels. Large storage platforms are spread out in the various outposts and you can collect their schedules (forgot the word they use in game, itinerary?). using your box, you can fast travel to other outposts but you need the schedule of the outpost you wish to travel to.   A lot of the story comes from the tapes that you can listen to, now as I've said, there is little reason to run across the map to your next objective, unless you want to listen to the tapes. As soon as you interrupt a tape's play through, you have begin again.   The graphics are truly breath taking and the game has whacky and zany ♥♥♥♥ like all the other MGS games. Emmerich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ his pants, weird as super natural powered enemies and jiggle physics ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).  The customization is fun, considering the lack of it from previous games. It's not up there with the likes of Battlefield or other similar games where you can change the handle, site and barrel of the weapon. But its still cool to have.  All in all, i'd give it a solid 8/10. It's a good game, a great game in fact, but its far from perfect for each and every person out there.",1,0

339350,Choice of Robots,"Don't get fooled by the play time not by the simplicity of the game, I've played this game over and over. And I am awestruck...  I sort of ceased being entertained by games, I found them often to be too simple, too basic, but Choice of Robots did something I have not been prepared for. When I launched the game I was expecting a whimsical futuristic tale, instead I was tossed into an emotional shredding machine, by the time I was done with the game I... cannot explain this. For the first time in my life I understood what it means to love you child, and by god did I love mine. It combines the power of the book with the interactivity of a game to absorb you into the story, you will find yourself pensive about the deeper intricities of the game, I sure as hell am not the same person I was before.   It won't sate everybody however, unfortunately, but those who can appreciate books and futuristic tales will find riveting. Now I need to excuse myself while I cry myself to sleep.",1,0
470260,Event[0],"The game is quite interesting and the old 80's style computers actually bring me back to the tandy PC and macintosh I used as a kid. (Yes, I know, im old. I have probably forgotten more about computers then most of you will ever know). In many ways I love the game, and interacting with Kaizen the computer is a concept I have always found interesting. In other ways the computer is just a program in which you see a programers holy grail as you notices small bits of humanity in it. Then again, is it.  (Caution, I am not trying to give away to much but some information past this point could be a spoiler)   The game itself is nothing more then a solution finder with a few brief moments of action to beat the oxygen clock. Half the game is looking around for clues and the other half talking to Kaizen trying to convince it for hints or information. The game itself is quickly played and the gameplay for all endings changes little until the end. You can play threw near the end then just create a save point to return to just to see all the different endings to have to avoid playing threw what you have already done again.  I recomend this game as a good quick puzzle when its on sale. It is a good concept and opens the question to how much control should an AI be given in real life and how will people actually use it to keep control of others. It brings back fond memories and even has hints of HAL from yes that old movie. The downside of this game is its quickly over to soon. The puzzles, though some could be difficult is not much of a match and the solutions to many things is litteraly written on the walls. The plot is put together by remembering what little you can find of the old crew members from articles left behind and logs which you must carefuly put together yourself. And the ending is simply what you say and do at the end. Though there is several endings, it seems repetitive to play through the game again to see each ending, but then again, the game is short.  For me, this was less of a game and more of a interactive movie. I wish it had more to its plot, was longer to play through and had more on the characters. Maybe with time more will be added. I recomend this game to those who like a good puzzle and pays attention to details, but just like a movie, once its over, you know it. Not much point to do it again for a while. I would recommend it but be picky on your expectations with this one.",1,0

353560,Plug & Play,"Plug &amp; Play is delightfully bizarre in ways that are as unsettling as they are endearing.  The playfulness of the vignettes that seem so mix matched and nonsensical trace intimate analogies into a collage of weirdness. It’s pulling from the darkest areas of failed relationships - denied feelings, refusal to communicate, meaningless sex to avoid complicated questions - but in ways that feel hopeful more than pessimistic. Plug &amp; Play isn’t about something falling apart, but learning to pick yourself up when things don’t work out.  I don’t know that I’d consider it especially adept or subtle in how it goes about this, but its sincere commitment to say something important while painting an amusingly offbeat, sex obsessed world is consistently entertaining and surprisingly considered. It might look like madness from the outside, and it is to a point, but it’s madness with a purpose but which also doesn’t get so caught up in showing how much life can suck that it forgets it can also be pretty fun sometimes.

If you are playing with a friend local co-op mode, I highly recommend playing the game in hard difficulty mode (we played the first 90% in medium then switched to hard in the last 10% - so much better in hard!). Guaranteed laughters. (e.g. accidentally falling off the edge and doing silly things :)  Overall, 10/10 for the lightweight and entertaining gameplay elements.

I would recommend it if the thing didn't run slower than the lovechild of watchdogs and arma 3, at least those games have more reason to lag, not this game with it's simple ♥♥♥ world spaces.

256290,Child of Light,"My review for Child of Light:  First of all, I'm going to address 2 concerns that I found in Steam community hub: 1. Uplay Those who're going to buy this game should know that this game is going to use Uplay, Ubisoft own game client. I noticed that many people dislike Uplay for certain reason so gonna respect that. I have my own issue with Uplay as well. So if you want to buy this game, make sure you know what you're getting into.  2. Day 1 DLC When the game is released, the dev put several DLCs immediately, including Golem DLC and Dark Aurora DLC which is the Special Edition bonus DLCs, Light Aurora DLC which is the preorder bonus and several 'cheat' DLC which you can buy extra oculis for your game. Golem DLC gives you a new party member and a small quest to get him, while Light Aurora and Dark Aurora DLC give you skins for Aurora and extra oculis and bonus stats. The 'cheat' DLC is actually consists of oculis, which means you can buy the oculis using real money once. Among these DLCs, only Golem DLC adds a bit of content while the skins just for eye candy. As much as I hate day 1 DLC, if you want to support the dev, buy the Golem and the skins DLC only. Of course you can ignore the DLCs if you don't want to support day 1 DLCs. I myself didn't bought any of the DLCs except Light Aurora since I preorder it.  In this game, you're playing as Aurora, a princess who died and reborn into Kingdom of Lemuria. Story progress smoothly, gaining allies and some plot twist. However, the ending is kinda not to say lame, acceptable but not much impact. There are no voice narration for this game except the narrator herself. Somehow, I wish that each character got their own voices to add more personalities to the characters. You can quite rush the game since the story is quite short. And you can restart again with New Game+ feature so you can start the game with OP Aurora.  The artstyle and graphic is beautiful. When you move Aurora around, you can see her hair move depends on the directions. The backgrounds and landscape are nicely drawn. Character animation during combat is kinda static. And the graphic glitch for Aurora’s hair where she transform into a tomboy during battle is not favorable by many, though I can deal with that.   Now lets talk about combat. It's 2v3 style, where you can bring 2 members in your party to fight 1 to 3 monsters at a time. but you can only change party members during combat and not outside which is annoying. At least let the player decide which member goes on combat first. Before combat, you can only manage on the oculis to be equipped on each party members and use any skill points or healing items. In combat, there will be a timeline. Each member and monsters will be on the timeline. When you reach the casting point, you can give order to the said member ie attack, use item or switch party member. After selecting the action, there will be another timeline for casting. If you're attacked during this time, your attack will be cancelled and you'll be pushed back on the timeline which is also known as interrupt. You can also use this to your advantage to prevent monsters from attacking you. There are no visible health bar for enemies and no bestiary to see the weakness of each enemies so you have to discover it yourself, although some of them are kinda easy to spot. During combat, you can also control Igniculus, which is very useful in combat. he can highlight enemies and show it on the timeline. He can also slow down enemies by blinding them, making their progress on the timeline slower for more tactical approach. He can also heal you. To recharge his energy meter, he can either use potion or just shake the light source and collect the light.  There is oculi crafting in this game, which is combining gems to make different and stronger oculis. Only 3 recipes are showed in the game, others you have to discover yourself (we got internet though ;D). Each oculi type has different effect depending on where you equip it. There are 8 types of oculis; 6 can be found in chests and defeating monsters, the other 2 need to be crafted. There is only 1 secret recipe for a special gem, but other than that, just normal crafting stuff. I wish they had put more depth to the crafting part since it's the essential part in the game.  Each character has their own skill tree. Each skill tree got 3 branches and you can focus on either 1 branch first or balancing between each branch. Each branch focus on 1 special skill for the character. Example for Aurora, she got Slash (physical attack), Light Beam (magic, light damage) and Super Light Beam (magic, light damage, can 1 hit KO) (Disclaimer: The skill name is not correct :P). Each skill will have single targeting or multiple. And no character has similar skills, so it's good to know which one you wanna use during combat. Unfortunately, there's no explanation about the skills during combat, which make it hard for players to choose skills. There's also passive skills available, like Counter-Attack, Counter-Heal etc and it helps very much during combat.  The soundtrack, is a masterpiece. I enjoyed every one of the songs. When I first started the game, I was stuck at the main menu because the song at the time, which is Aurora's Theme is mesmerizing. Even the songs during normal battle and boss fight is good and make me more enthusiastic to play. You can buy the digital album from here or you can listen to it on Spotify. Give it a go, I'm sure you'll like it.  Overall, for the $14.99 price tag, it's totally worth the price. I still need to highlight that this game is not for Uplay haters and Steam elitists, because this game use Uplay as DRM so buying for Steam means using 2 DRMs at a time which is not acceptable for some people (you can see it in the community hub, people still b*tching about it lol). And Uplay is still in growing stage and need much more improvement. Other than that, this game is good and I totally recommend this game especially to RPG fans. ",1,1
278360,A Story About My Uncle,"No game has ever made me write a review about it after finishing it, but my god this a wonderful game. I won't go into a whole lot about the pros and cons of the game since that has been done very thoroughly in the myriad of great reviews about the game, but I just needed to throw it out there that I haven't played a videogame in a long time that made me feel the feels that this one spurred on. It really is quite a gem and I recommend anyone with a few hours to kill and a desire to see a beautiful game from the aesthetic to the storyline to pick it up.

225300,Tomb Raider II,"I will resume this game in one word, punishing. So i will break this down easily, when you are making a game, you must adjust the difficulty according to the gameplay mechanics avalibable. The game is clrearly much more hard than the first one (which is nice) but the problem is its badly directed the way they want you to go across all the things. Lets say that if this game has the mechanics and flexibility the TR of the 2000's, it would be an awesome game with just about the right difficulty to keep it chalenging while still punishing you for the mistakes you make. I'm also aware the game has almost 20 years old, but man I grow playing this old games and believe me when I say that it was a common mistake the idea of implementing extreme difficulty with low and unflexible mechanics in games, you may say: 'that is the whole idea' if that so, then why with the advance in tecnology we have, the games are getting more easy? 2 reasons, as the time passes by the mechanics become more natural, the characters are more easy to control and they do less award things and are A LOT more responsive at any command you throw them and the second is marketing (for the sake of hitting the most amount of audiencie possible so everyone can enjoy, therefor much more money).  Now putting aside the unflexible gameplay, the game is pretty solid, havent played enough to talk about the history but seems 'OK', the level desing is pretty awesome and is really well desing to hide the secrets (except for a part on the first level where there is like 2 pickups that require EXTREME coordination (not impossible though) that is more a flaw in the engine where if you are nearby an item lara won't walk to it and interact with it (like underwater) you must step right up and then you can pick it up and this is really annoying because this 2 pickups are in a context where if you aren't fast enough you die and if you pick them up you must pay with a little blood (usually more than 15% of your health, but if you were fast you could make it in one piece but is really hardly likely to happen.), the sound effects has changed a little since the last game and are fairly better, graphics are a bit better (mostly lara's model because now she has her pony tale and it also moves when she runs and if you are in an outside level and idle, the hair will simulate the breeze of wind) and texture overall are at the same quality as the last one, and for the year this game was released they were amazing. Menu still uses the same base, now the compass (which was useless as I never use it) is gone and replaced with a chronometer which give you stats on your game so far, from time taken, secrets founds (which are now 3 little statues per level), and ammo/health packs used, so a pretty nice progress. Also nice progress on the video department, the game doesnt require a DOS OP/DOSbox because windwos 95/98 where already a thing for most PC at the time, plus now in the first start of the game now displays a menu so you can configure it, and the best thing is the res of the game it adapts according to your video card (basically you can run the game on +720p without any problem nor needing to installing nothing).   -Some annoying bugs: -if the 'roof' is a bit close to you, you cant perform a jump at all, and this didnt happen with his successor -If you have custom controls, whenever you relaunch the game, it will use both (your bindings and the default ones, just like the first game) so you need to go to controls in the menu and reselect (everytime you wanna play) 'user controls', otherwise if you bind the space bar with jump you will jump but you also grab your guns.  TL;DR: the game is too punishing for the unflexiblie gameplay/mechanics it has, also the desingners could have done a better job (like as they allowed you to roll in the air and underwater) with some minor details like the way you need to be near an item to pick it up or interact with it on land, grab some of the edges with a less level of exigency and climbing a LOT faster. If you dont mind that things go ahead and play it, otherwise, skip yourself a possible butthurt",-1,0

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Hard as hell, but once you learn the basics, one of my favorite games of all time",1,0
237740,Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures,"There is a hidden genre of game known only among the hardcore: 'platform hell.' Among its top echelon is the classic, 'I Wanna Be The Guy,' which inspired Steam games Super Meat Boy and VVVVVV. Platform Hell games are identified by one simple trait: the game knows what you are about to do, and punishes you for doing something predictable. A cloud mighdisappear as you land on it, for example, or an apple may fall off a tree UPWARDS as you attempt to jump over it.  As a cataloguer of terrible video game tropes, it is natural that the Angry Video Game Nerds includes many, many, surprises in this game. However, AVGN-Adventures is nowhere near as difficult as these other platformers and is slightly less fun.    The Good:    * Awesome level variety harkening back to several classic video games.  * Dozens of allusions, cameos, and references to Angry Video Game Nerd episodes, classic video games, and video game tropes.  * Your character's light-gun changes color depending on the difficulty level. Pink for easy, orange for normal, and gray for 'old school.' (I was never able to reach one of the higher, unlockable difficulty levels).  * Like Nintendo games of yore, there are plenty of secrets to find.  * Great use of humor.  * Each level ends with a unique boss from nerd-culture.  * Fantastic pause music.    The Bad:    * The levels are a bit short, although they make up it with their difficulty.  * The 'You've got Skill' Steam achievement is duplicated... there are two of them for some reason.  * Control Issue: It is hard to fire your gun to the right if you recently started moving left, and vice-versa. This becomes very annoying.  * Some enemies, like the reindeer on the snow level, have 'magnetism' or something and stay right ON your sprite. since your gun can only fire outwards, it makes them lethal and unfair to fight.  * The game uses the enter key as a pause button, but if you shift+tab out of the game to talk to someone, anytime you hit enter to send your message, the game pauses/unpauses.  * The only level that is truly 'really difficult' is the last one, which is only unlockable after completing all other levels.     The Ugly:    * At times, the game felt more like a chore than a game. I got bored after playing through the first level, but only stuck it out to write this review.  * The game only has a few special items: useless rocks, super scope, 'glitch man,' and 'mecha Jesus.' (I'm making up my own names for these things, I forgot what they're killed.) I was expecting to discover more items as the game continued, but no, there are just the four of them.     The Verdict:    * Pick this up if you like AVGN or platformers, but don't expect a rock-solid experience. I personally did not enjoy my time with it.",-1,0

Barring the fact that I had a blue-screen mid stream (Crashes happen, although while streaming they are very painful).  ** Issue #1 ** Significantly too short. I finished the episode in 1:30. That includes the time it took me to crash, restart, load up my stream, and resume playing and replay through from my last auto-save... If the remaining episodes will be included free as part of the $22 I spent on this, then it may be worth the price, but having to wait to play a game in full when I was under the impression that it was a full game, not an 'early release'...  ** Issue #2 ** Not NEARLY enough time to make choices. I sometimes clicked at the last second and it didn't register, or spent 2 seconds looking at chat to look back and realize I missed a decision point. I guess the game is so short I can do it over...  ** Issue #3 ** Besides dialogue, there was no other choice. In fact, the 'challenges' were button-mashing (PRESS Q A BUNCH OF TIMES REALLY FAST) or the occasional 'DDR-Lite' where you have to press A, S, D, or W to avoid an attack. At best it was an interactive cut-scene where I occasionally did button mashing. Far cry from being able to freely build whatever I want in minecraft...  ** Issue #4 ** I mis-clicked on character creation. I couldn't go back, I couldn't undo, I was stuck with the character I selected. I even tried the 'go back a menu' and it wouldn't let me go back. SO, when picking a character MAKE SURE YOU PICK THE ONE YOU WANT.  ** What I actually Liked ** I didn't hate the experience, just had lots of issues. The story was 'OK' although the story tries to carve you out as a weak and uncool kid, which makes all the 'I'm awesome and kickass' dialogue options seem extremely out of place (even though I chose them, because I'm awesome and kickass). I DID want to continue playing. When the credits rolled I was left with two feelings: 'HOLY CRAP IT'S OVER, WTF, THIS WAS JUST BARELY AN HOUR' and 'WHY IS THE NEXT EPISODE HERE' But for $22 I could have bought an entire TV season of Doctor Who and had 12+ hours of entertainment, whereas I got 1 1/2 hours of entertainment here and a sore finger (from mashing the Q button, BTW - Telltale, you owe me a new Q button).

This is one of my favourite game of all time. It is the best competitive shooter in my opinion and definitely surpasses CS:GO in every possible way: from the gameplay, all the way to the community. It gets updated frequently and every update makes the game better. It has unique operators, maps and mechanics. The multiplayer is sometimes a bit unfair as you get in matches against people with a way higher level than yours, however you always learn new stuff during those games. All in all, just buy the game and you're guaranteed to have a good time.   9.8/10 Here are the five words that describe this game the best: unique, challenging, fun, epic, competitive.

409100,The Purring Quest,"The Purring Quest is a cute platformer where you play as a cat. The game takes place on a twodimensional plane where you (the cat) has to jump, climb, claw weaker enemies, and avoid bigger enemies like dogs. Along the way there are collectibles: each level has 200 rotten fish to find, one trapped cat, and one other item.  The strengths of the game are in how it feels like you really are playing a cat, with a world that looks to scale and plausible dangers. It is an 'epic quest' but on cat scale. There is no voiced dialog, but at several times the story is told through textboxes. Which is a bit of a shame as the game intro is completely textless but succeeds perfectly in telling the game's story, and is excellently animated for this game style.  Good points are how good the main character is controllable -- as long as you use a controller. The game offers two different jump styles: long jump and double-jump. You can switch as you start the game to a style that you like best. I also tried keyboard controls, but they don't feel as responsive as the controller does. The levels are all relatively easy to get through with a boss fight or other challenge at the end, but they're all very possible. The challenge comes from finding all hidden items. In level three you get a hiding ability that made me laugh... Solid Cat.  Bad points are that the game occasionally likes to hide enemies behind foreground effects. This leads to a cheap death. You do get seven lives and even if you die seven times you can respawn at a checkpoint, but cheap deaths are never fun. You also have falling damage... for a cat. Thematically that just feels wrong.  The game starts in a pretty dark level at a graveyard which may be too scary for younger players - not that anything bad happens, but the mood can be scary. Afterwards everything is lighter and more fun so if playing with a young child consider starting them at level two.  Overall fun game and definitely worth checking out if you like platformers.",1,0

50620,Darksiders,"A hack 'n slash and puzzle enviroment game where you play as the apocolyptic horseman War, killing angels and demons with a giant two handed sword, made of skeletons called Chaos eater. War the first horse man is basically tricked into starting the apocolypse by angels and demons. Is imprisoned by the charred council ( a neutral party). When he gets back out, he gets his revenge on everyone involved in using him as the scape goat. Witch you find out that their is a huge conspiracy between ALL parties. Ending with War summoning the other horseman (Death, Strife, Fury) to help him get final justice. With crazy blood graphics and a very creative take and artwork of earth after the apocolypse with angel and demon outposts, I loved hacking through this game with Chaos eater. Also with wrath abilities that are basic magic upgrades you'd expect the horseman War would have, his red horse Ruin and lots of custimizable equipment and weapons you find yourself searching for enimies to kill, bosses to fight and waiting for the next bloody vengeful cut scene where War is not ever happy with how he is being treated. Did i mention he has a super mode called Chaos form in witch with in a short amount of time, you become the giant fiery horned abomitable imbodiment of War itself and kill EVERYTHING.",1,0

454690,Cyber City 2157: The Visual Novel,"Cyber City 2157 is a rather unique Visual Novel and for this VN, it wasn't necessarily a bad thing.  With all the VNs in the market these days, its very common to find them with nice pristine and crisp art with the characters that they do have, but Cyber City 2157 takes it retro style. Everything feels like it did when I was a kid and because of that, it wasn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I actually found it quite appealing to start at least. The story for this game starts off very confusing and then they slowly start unveiling more and more about it. As this is a VN with multiple paths but connections (to a degree) with each, the story became more and more clear. Regardless of that, the story was way better than those fanservice 'dating sim' games that have the most forced stories ever.  I cannot talk as much about this game because there were not exactly blatant flaws that I did not like nor any WOWs other than the ones I talked about. However, since overall I did not feel any negative sentiment from playing this VN, I woudl recommend Cyber CIty 2157.  Rating: 7.4/10 Recommend Price: $1 or below",1,1

307590,Penarium,"You know that face you make when your playing an extremely difficult game and your trying to concentrate as hard as possible to not die? Well that's what Penarium does to me. Penarium is a rage-inducingly difficult platformer survival game where you will always feel determined to be able to complete the next level how ever many deaths it takes.   In penarium you control a boy called Willy. He strives to become a top circus performer. His wish comes true when a travelling circus man comes and introduces himself to him. However it's not as he expected. Willy is sent to entertain a crowd of bloodthirsty sadistic people. His goal is to survive in increasingly difficult circus stadiums while being attacked by various different traps. Definitely not an easy task.   That is the main premise of Penarium. You are basically in a small arena that is filled with various traps. You can jump across platforms to avoid these traps. Within these rooms you have different tasks to complete. This can be something as simple as collecting barrels or something difficult like having to stay in a moving spotlight for the allocated amount of time. There was a suprising amount of variety in these different tasks and I didn't find myself getting bored of them at all. My favourite of the tasks was basically a 'simon says' where you have to copy the pattern of pressed buttons in the correct order.   While doing these tasks the traps will change frequently giving you different things to avoid. This keeps the gameplay a challenge and means you can't learn the patterns to make it too easy. The traps you are given are semi-random as well as the patterns they move in. Some levels have a scripted set of traps and others are completely random. There is also a fantastic variety in the types of traps. Each are unique in their own way. They include traps like homing missiles, electric cannons, moving lasers and birds that fly away with the barrels. They each require very different strategies to avoid them and so change up the gameplay for you constantly.   Penarium has 3 different gamemodes. Within the campaign mode you get all of these different modes that I described above. They are organized into levels of increasing difficulty. There isn't a huge of levels in the game being only 30 levels total. However with the insane difficulty that I mentioned earlier they will take a long time to complete each. I estimate i've probably spent around 4 hours on the campaign so far and gotten to level 23.   It then has the arcade mode. This is a pure survival mode. It uses the barrel gamemode. You have to collect as many barrels as possible. It is unlimited and completely random. Attached to this gamemode is a leaderboard so that you can compete against your friends to collect the most barrels possible. This is a nice additional feature because the gamemode would be incomplete without it.   The final gamemode is multiplayer. This is split into 2 submodes which are versus and co-op. This is probably where I had my most fun playing. In versus mode you compete with the other player to click each button that spawns first. You also have the added ability to jump on the other persons head and knock them out for a short period. I had a huge amount of fun in this mode. Then you have co-op. In this mode each of you has a different button to press and you have to stand on them at the same time. Again it is a survival mode and you have to try and do it for as long as possible. There is also a leaderboard attached to this. Unfortunately multiplayer is only local though and can only be enjoyed by a maximum of two people. I would have liked to at least see online multiplayer implemented.   Within the arcade mode you also have a store. This can be used to purchase upgrades that can be used to help you survive longer. I haven't had much of a chance to test this but I thought it was worth mentioning. However i'm not a big fan of this system and would prefer just a straight up survival with no additional benefits.   Penarium itself also has a certain charm to it. The graphics style is designed in a striking pixel art fashion which I absolutely adore. Arenas could very easily be bland and static but they have so much variety to them graphically. The backgrounds are even full of activity and animations that make the world seem very much alive. Penariums cutscenes also have a wonderful charm to them. The voiceover is mesmerizingly good and really sets you in the mood of the game. A wonderful circus soundtrack also helps to build this atmosphere. The only issue I do have with the soundrack is that it can get very repetitive after a while because it doesn't have enough variety.   Overall if you love difficult games and are a fan of platformers then Penarium is definitely a game for you. The developer has gone all out to create an experience full of variety and a beatifully styled world with a unique charm to it. However if you don't like difficult games then you can safely avoid Penarium as it definitely isn't a game for you. But if you do I think the price of £6.99 is more than reasonable for the insane amount of fun you will get.   TheIronicGamers rating system     Don't ever buy this game.    Maybe consider it on a sale.    An average game.     A good game that should definitely be considered.     A must play!

342200,MechWarrior Online,"I'll try to keep this brief -   As a Founder from back in 2011/2012 I've played a lot of MWO ever since. I've also played a lot of Mechwarrior dating back to the 90's (Mechwarrior 2: 31st Century Combat) and I can safely say this is the best core 'mech combat I've ever played. They have the feel down and the graphics and art assets are beautiful. Battlemechs have never looked or felt better.  Despite some publisher gimmicks (IGP has since dissolved and is no longer running things) PGI has continued to improve MWO at an accelerated pace and if you like giant stompy 'mechs you will enjoy the core combat.  If there are any negatives I'd sum them up by saying that this game is very likely not going to expand much past an arena 'mech shooter, as much as I wanted it to be something like Mechwarrior EvE Online (in terms of economy and depth) I just don't think that's going to happen.  Even so, I'm ok with that and the 'mech combat itself is pretty deep in that you can customize everything under the sun and again, it's very enjoyabe to play. I'd recommend this game easily if you like the concept or are intrigued and enjoy a 'thinking man's shooter'. Or just plain like blowing stuff up, because in MWO, lots of thing blow up and blow up beautifully.",1,0

You start off in the Copper Age and advance your family the way you want to. You can choose between social advancement (which can catapult your family to noble ranks), heroic adventures (which can become a revolution) or inventions (which opens up new techs).  I would recommend the game to everybody, that likes a little board game paired with casual strategy and a nice narrative. :)",1,0

205100,Dishonored,"Within the realm of Dishonored, you play Corvo Attono. Corvo is given supernatural powers by 'The Outsider' after he was framed for murdering the Emperess of Dunwall. The powers that are given to you allow you to play the game through in different playstyles. Short range teleportation and time stopping can be used both in a violent manner, such as stopping time, teleporting behind enemies and shooting them in the back, or a non-violent manner. Such as teleporting around enemies or stopping time to run past them. On my first playthrough, I played through as non-lethal as possible. This playthrough took me about 12 hours. I am currently on my third hour of my second playthrough; about 3/4 of the way through, Killing everything that gets in my way, the game is considerably shorter but just fun as I do not need to know any of the plot I may be missing. I find it odd that a such a short singleplayer only game can be marketed at 60$ on release it does have some replay value though.",1,0

The gameplay and setting is simple, pretty much stealth-based in a (very creepy) asylum, but what makes it so terrifying are the very same simple elements. Using only a camera equipped with night vision and batteries that can be depleted, you truly do not know what to expect around every corner or from the Asylum residents (patients?). The no-combat, all survival mechanics also add to the tense gameplay and the very disturbing atmosphere. One of the best games in this genre that I've played in a very long time that has actually managed to creep me out.",1,0

255710,Cities: Skylines,"ABSOLUTELY MARVELOUS! This is THE simulated city game, one that will be remembered a decade from now.  PROS: -Large maps, quite the accomplishment to run out of building space  -Steam Workshop - Mods/Assets - Pleasantly overwhelmed by the amount of content - nearly every conceivable vehicle make/model, military equipment, airline, vegetation/tree/bush, buildings, statues, and landmarks have been created.   -Maps - easy to make, easy to get off the workshop, game comes with some of course. There's a terrain party website that can copy the topography of your own town/city. Combined with the capability to make your own assets/buildings/props/etc... one can quite accurately recreate their own neighborhood!  -Beautiful! I can run at low res on my laptop or test the gpu on the pc! Tree's sway, chimneys smoke, traffic signals change, every citizen has a name/education level/job/specialty, every building a tenant/resident, every vehicle a destination... attention to detail(s) is obvious.  -Replay Value - Nigh near impossible to create an identical city! Would be worth it at $60usd... the game actually costs &lt;$30... one of the most satisfying purchases I've ever made.  -Self propelled gameplay - building a city can take an hour or a month - its up to you.  -Sometimes I don't even play the game, rather, I'll hop in the cab of a garbage truck and cruise the town for an hour in 1st person mode.  -Stuck it to EA real good!   NOT PROS  -Mods/Assets - it is easy to get overwhelmed. I'd recommend starting without and visit the workshop as needed. Additionally, the in-game menu bars fill up quickly causing side scrolling 200 items to be tedious. Perhaps a wide top-down scroll would be more efficient.  -Sometimes a custom mod/asset will have an error bug.... to be expected. Only time this really mattered was when the After Dark expansion was released - mods that were not updated caused loss of work. Most relevant assets are now after-dark compatable.  -Water physics - the water looks great in this game, however, water has trouble getting into small cracks/canals/crevaces. Making tsunamis is fun/dangerous too:)  -No disastrous events. Could have potential with weather - ie - lightning striking highrises at night - causes fire, fog causing traffic pile-ups, random tsunami",1,0

When you finally get one that doesn't take 20 minutes to solve 1 part after completing all other parts you'll praise RNGesus. I'm serious, this game requires so much backtracking it's not even funny. RNG and blind guessing at it's finest. Don't bother buying it at full price, it's not even worth $1.99 let alone a dollar more.

Granted, the game suffers from the late game boringness of just stomping those that remain (like almost all strategy games), everything else is fluid and interesting. I particularly liked the fact that they added in a face editor so that you can import your own portraits without having to use third party software.  If you like the turn based strategy genre then I guarentee you'll like this game, if not then unless you're willing to take on the steep learning curve (that the tutorial does little to help) you probably won't enjoy yourself too much.

It's not just this decision to bring in crates but the steadily decreasing quality of each paid expansion that has prompted me to post this bad rewiew.   If you want a good replacement play Warframe, they are a F2P where you can reasonably earn everything through play save for cosmetic parts.

It's cheap, adaptable, fun, and the community is one of the largest and most friendly out of any game I have ever played. You will get stuck onto certian servers of TTT, Murder, or just sandbox by yourself testing out everything and possible having 179 addons (Well, yeah, thats my highest amount of addons at one time, but its a lot shorter now) at the same time, testing Hatsune Miku NPC's to hitting them in the face with the Gaben Hammer.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,TL;DR version at the bottem  Rant: Rampant hackers capable of getting you banned by spawning money on you. Anti-cheat bots banning you for 'third party software' while using default client. Website support could not care less about you while phone support hands away unbans like oprah hands away everything. Payed moderators working for rockstar dont abide by the EULA and Terms and conditions while filling out bans on you. Often times you dont get a reason for a ban until you post an appeal. nineteen out of twenty people KOS (kill on sight) you when encountered on multiplayer. The controls are optimised for console so flying is difficult and the in game menus can be like that too Now that im done with my rant here are the upsides:  Great multiplayer for light play Singleplayer is story driven hilarious and can often times be unrivaled No superpowers or over repeated maps like some games *cough cough* Saints row *cough cough* Singleplayer is still avalible after being banned Most hackers do get caught but the sheer number of them catch up to that You spend enough time into this game and you really get rewards (on demand fighter jet) Huge varity of people play this (ive made a few steam friends)    TL;DR Anticheat resembles norton Players resemble that of COD in terms of killing Singleplayer is fun Freaking missles everywhere Support hates you if they arent on their phone,-1,0

26800,Braid,"Braid was a unique twist for me, in a world where I thought I had seen every style of platformer.  Braid plays in a similar vein to late-game Toki Tori levels; your character has some control over time as its primary action, but I would say Braid takes the time manipulation to a stronger level.  The main theme outside of time manipulation is the puzzles; each room of the house contains space for a puzzle whose pieces you are collecting as you play. After each 'world' is completed, you put together the simple puzzle, and move on to the next world. As you progress, books on podiums prior to entering the world tell parts of your story.  Time manipulation plays a large role in the game, and becomes crucial as you get closer and closer to the end. It was a new playstyle for me, but definitely fun to work with to solve some of the puzzles. I think the puzzles, in addition to the story, were well-crafted. I initially ignored parts of the story, but it does end up being pretty good.  If you like puzzle/platformers, you'll like Braid.",1,0

It does become a bit repetitive but you can leave for a week or so and then get back to mindless slaughtering.  There is one major problem I found with it so far and that is health gaps. From act 4 normal to act 1 nightmare, there is a massive jump in health. Enemies go from like 4k to 50k. They are like mini-bosses and are sponges. I have loads of relics and have 75% Damage Reduction so the enemies deal like 100 damage to me, so I can just sit there spamming, which is a bit boring.

Playing as Fable sheriff Bigby Wolf (The big bad wolf) you have a bad reputation for having a temper and violent tendencies. The games theme is based around judgement of character and lets you choose to whether live up to your tenacity or redeem yourself in the folks that you serve and protect.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"My most favorite game ever, I probably love it too much. changing from an older gen console, xbox 360, GTA 5 for PC is a HUGE imrpovement. Graphics, (unsupported) modding, hundreds of addicting hours of fun that definitely satisfy me, it has it all. I'm not quite sure what it is, maybe the ability to kill people easily without dying, maybe it's because I'm able to dominate an entire city as a cow, or maybe, jsut maybe, it's because I can use a cargobob and bring a tank to the top of the maze bank building and shoot helicopter/planes down. Whatever it is, this game definitely has it. (I got over 100 hours in the first week, although I did leave it running for quite some time).",1,0

237850,Dreamfall Chapters,"I've been a fan of The Longest Journey since I came across Dreamfall: The Longest Journey and it left me in a state of emptiness after I finished it, like the feeling you get after you finish a book. I found out about The Longest Journey and played it as well and ever since, The Longest Journey and Dreamfall are one of my favorites games of all time. This game was a gift to me, and it remains to be the best gift I've ever received.  When I learned they would be making a sequel to my favorite games I was so happy but frustrated that I would have to wait so long, but it was worth the waiting! If you're into fantasy, cyberpunk, adventure and story this game will have you come back to it's universe   Stark and Arcadia   over and over again to meet some of the best told and designed characters in amazingly made two different worlds.   Previously, I recommended this game to my friends but I told them they should play the previous games before this one to understand the story and love it, but as I progressed, I saw that this game alone has so much to offer even if you don't know much about the universe the story keeps introducing new characters and shows how the old ones changed as the worlds kept changing. So, even if you haven't played the other games I totally recommend it and I believe it's worth your money.  If you've played the previous games I doubt I need to say more because this game takes the story where it left off.   As soon as you start the game and see the opening cutscene, the game says ''this journey is not going to be an easy one''.     The game has one of the best stories I've ever heard, read or seen and it NEVER lost its magic for me, I was never bored in any part of the game, there was always something else to be curious about something else to explore and understand and try to figure out. The moment you start your Journey, you should be ready to be surprised by anything because this universe is anything but boring. I enjoyed every single moment of it. Exploring the world in Dreamfall: Chapters was especially amazing because of the improved graphics. Every place you wander will have it's own magic with their own colors and a theme unique to them. The game has a fantasy side to it but not in a universe that is filled with Elves and Orcs or Angels and Demons. It introduces so many races with their unique cultures, designs and stories. They beautifully fit in the games universe and they shape it into what it is. The cyberpunk side of the game doesn't look as unique as it's fantasy side, but it brings humans from different cultures together and you will be seeing how they blend in the futuristic world of TLJ. The voice acting is great dialogues are not dull and if you take your time to interact with objects around yourself the protagonist will comment on the objects and Zoë tends to have interesting things to say about pretty much everything. I like her style. Her voice actress is different from the previous game but she does a great job as well. And as I said the story is amazing but I loved how it pulled me in and at some point I was so mad at something that happened I decided harshly and the consequences were so awful it made me feel horrible. So, yes the decisions you make, so far, have great effects, makes you consider the tiniest things over and over again. I hope the fifth book will live up to my expectations and my decisions will affect how the game ends. Though, I'm not sure if I can handle it if it ends badly because of my poor decisions, I will be crossing my fingers.  Yes, I really love the series and I really love this game but I do feel like I must complain about some things that made me frustrated. The controls are bad, sadly. And when you run, you're basically not so much running. So, the exploring part gets a little bit too slow. I'm not saying I don't like exploring, I would've ran around my favorite places over and over again. Well, running is more like fast-paced walking and the animation seems like it as well so I guess it fits. Puzzles are not enough challenging compared to TLJ but considering I was, at some point, randomly clicking on everything trying to find something that works in TLJ maybe this is for the best. Some animations look a little funny but the scenery makes up for it greatly. Some objects are hard to interact with, you need to hover your mouse on them a few times before you can interact. There are some collision problems and I hate not being able to go up some stairs just because they're not important. They're stairs, they're right infront of me, they're wide open for me to walk on, but the game just won't let me. Yes, it is pointless to go up those stairs but I want to.",1,0

350810,Pixel Puzzles 2: Anime,"I played this game after I finished Pixel Puzzles Japan. This game is easier to pick up pieces than Pixel Puzzles Japan. It is harder and longer to beat because the pieces can be rotated. The game now saves puzzle progress so you can exit the puzzle anytime you want, unlike Pixel Puzzles Japan which remove your puzzle progress. Still doesn't support Steam Cloud Synchronization. I can't load the game with another computer.  All pictures are anime alike, but none of them come from real anime. The gallery shows picture in small size and completed puzzle still have pieces curves and pixel pixie is floating in the middle of the image, I can't take a screenshot of them to make a desktop wallpaper. Too bad.  Easy achievements. Basically finish all the puzzles = 100% achievements. Trading cards. Their prices are quite high.  There is hint level bar which filled when you put the pieces correctly. Pixel pixie occasionally fills the bar. Hiding pixel pixie will stop her to fill your hint level bar. Lv 1. Flash Ghost Image (Temporarily shows full image for about 3s) Lv 2. Correct Rotation (Press &lt;ctrl&gt; while holding a piece, and it will be rotated correctly) Lv 3. Show Location (Press &lt;space&gt; while holding a piece, and it will flash its location. The piece rotation is not corrected) There are 25 puzzles + 1 DL-TV puzzle to play. From 60 pcs to 350pcs. If you like anime, and jigsaw puzzles, you might like this game. Note that because of rotating pieces, It took over 4 hours for me to finish the biggest puzzle with 350pcs.",1,0

There may be some balance issues between the unit classes you have, and some may not like having most of the classes be permutations on three main classes, but it didn't get repetitive over my playthrough. Massive Chalice may not be a great game for repeated playthroughs, but it was fantastic for a one-off. I love eet.",1,0

107100,Bastion,"10/10  This is one of the few games I'd recommend for absolutely everyone. It's absolutely superb in every way possible. Story, art, music, gameplay... Everything.  The art in this game is absolutely stunning. The art style, the multitude of colors and the way the scenery is composed makes the player feel like he/she is playing inside one of the world's greatests works of art.  Gameplay is simple and easy to play, yet mastering the game requires practice. There are no irrelevant weapon upgrades, each and every one of them are great improvements to their respective weapon. Likewise, spirits are also huge improvements. The combination of different weapons, different weapon upgrades, spirits and secret skills makes for an extremely varied gameplay, going from full heads-on approaches towards enemies to more tactical approaches.  The game lasts long enough to have the player invest at least a few hours in the game in his/her first playthrough, while also not being too long so that it feels unnecessarely stretched. Extra modes like New Game Plus add a lot to the game's replay value.  It's hard to even come up with any flaws to mention here. The only one I could think of are some of the Shrine Idols, that can cause the game to become way too hard and not make up for the bonuses they give. But since Idols are completely optional, I wouldn't consider it a flaw.",1,0

Good: -Learning curve is just right (although I'm a professional programmer- might be daunting to non-programmers. -Interesting concept, not seen anything else like it -The PDF programming manual sets out the basics and sets the scene for the 'mystery' -The price is right  Bad: -No in game graphics. I'm assuming if there were any cut-scenes or the like, I would have seen something after 5 levels. Something to develop the story as you go rather than just cut and dried programming challenges would improve the game massively. -Could do with a bit more guidance on what to do when you first start playing. In-game tells you nothing. -Feels more like a tech-demo than a game -Could be so much more",-1,0

302510,Ryse: Son of Rome,"Very impressive graphics over the top of a relatively simple hack and slash game. The story is reasonable, taking you on an enjoyable adventure as your character, Marius, becomes a leader of a Roman Legion seeking retribution against the barbarians who threaten Rome. There isn't all that much to the game mechanics; you have standard attack, block, break guard moves and once you get used to the controls it is fairly straightforward. There are some nice death moves however, where you slice off arms and so on, but these do get a bit repetitive. The multiplayer modes work well in a gladiatorial arena setting, so that's fun for a while with friends. All in all, a game certainly worth picking up in sale for at least a few hours of enjoyment.",1,0

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"WARNING: This game might offend people that take their religion seriously. If you don't like to see any devil related content, its best advised NOT to buy it. Note: This game has a few references to other games made by the same person, its best advised to play Super Meat Boy and The Basement collection first before playing this.  The Binding of Isaac is a 2D dungeon game with a simlar concept of the first Legend of Zelda game made for the Nintendo Entertainment system in the 1980s. I find this game very fun to play because you have a bunch of objectives to do like challenges or completing the game multiple times to get different endings and also unlock new stuff to get in the dungeons. This game features: Multiple endings, Random dungeon maps, 50+ different types of enemies, and 100+ items to collect. If you like Dungeon games or played the 1st Legend of Zelda game then consider this game.  Cost: $5 (Base game) $3 (DLC) Rating: 79.5/100 Good",1,0

So far ive played roughly 30 minutes of the game, and the st-st-stutterrrring has made me want to tear my eyes out.   Keep in mind, im not exactly playing this on a potato (Gtx 980, amd fx-8350@4.5ghz). Ive noticed that the game engine may be affected by single-threaded cpu performance, as only core 1 on my chip is fully utilized at all times. I have a feeling this is what is causing the stuttering, seeing as how my gpu doesnt ever go over 80%utilization, yet my fps is floating around 80-105 ( I am using a 120hz display) These results are the same even when all in game graphics settings are lowered to the minimum.

The story is cheesy but the setting is interesting. It is worth mentioning that this is actually a sequel of sorts to Iron Storm as well.  Graphics were pretty good for the time and overall the game is great entertainment for its price. Despite its age the game works very well, which is an interesting point given that when it was originally released hardly anybody was able to play it due to an absolutely crippling amount of bugs in both running, loading, saving, and installing.  This game may also be made by wizards, I found I had access to some of my saves from 2005, long before I had a Steam or even used my current screen name, and I have been through several gaming computers since. Definitely witchcraft or sorcery, no doubt about it.  Pros: Quick mindless gunplay Customization Lots of weapons and levels Sweet armor Alternate history setting  Cons: Mediocre graphics Embarassing voice acting Forgettable storyline Cutscenes drag on a bit",1,1

342450,Sword Daughter,"Sword Daughter is the latest visual novel released by Hanako Games although the story is not a Hanako Games original. It was originally written by Rhondi Vilott, and it's representative of the 1980's 'choose your own adventure' type of series. I bring this up now to keep things in perspective.  Although I'm giving this game a positive review, there were some aspects that did annoy me. So I'll comment on the negative things first and then highlight the positive things.  As anyone who's read my reviews of VNs by now, story is the most important aspect for me in determining if I will end up liking a VN. Although I do like the genre somewhat (I like some fantasy aspects although not all; I'm one of those people who isn't a LOTR fan), the writing did put me off at first. It's rare for a story to use the second person perspective, simply because it is difficult to pull off. But I think that the author used it to make the reader engaged more in the story. Most of the characters are either likeable or tolerable, and I thought that the main character Tyrna was in the middle. Now as for the potential love interest Gavin, I didn't like him from the start. He finds Tyrna and depending on the choices that the player makes, Gavin can either be helpful or an obstacle in helping to advance the plot. Aside from that, I really didn't like how in a lot of paths, Gavin would suddenly proclaim his love for Tyrna. I mean, really? No one falls in love that quickly unless they're extremely young and then I don't even think they would fall in love that fast. Gavin annoyed me so much that I wish there was the option to punch him in the face. That would have made me happy. lol  However, these are the only negative aspects I found. So moving on to the positive aspects. The art is extremely beautiful. It's different from the usual art found in VNs but I think that this is fine because of the genre. The music was great, too, and fit pretty well with the scenes. I liked that there were 22 different endings to get and there were enough CGs to make it worth replaying for them as well as the endings.   As I am aware that Sword Daughter is the first in the 'Dragon Roads' series, I do hope that the next book in the series will be adapted to a VN format. I look forward to trying it out and have more hopefuly expectations for it. So yeah, I'm giving this game a thumbs up because I hope to see more.",1,0

So far the game is running smooth, 60 FPS in every cutscene and all the time I am running in the open world. Besides the menu, which does not support your mouse, everything is very well playable with a mouse and keyboard setup. I loved Peace Walker, so the only thing that annoys me -in the gameplay setting- is the missing coop (yes, it was not promised or anything, but as a PW-Lover I miss it.)   Two issues I have found: 1. The unability to alter your emblem, since you end up with like 3 FPS in the creationscreen.. 2. The unstable onlineconnection. Everytime I start the game, I am not able to sign in.   For the rating.. Since I am not only a fan of MGS in total.. But this is most probably the last MGS Hideo Kojima will ever make: 10/10 Despite the flaws that maybe exist currently (hopefully, they fix it in some way), it is the worthy completion to the MGS-franchise. In my 24 Hours, that I played this game so far, I don't think that 60€ (Not $ guys..) were to much for this epic game. I enjoyed at least 23.7 Hours of that.. the rest was creating an emblem ;o  ---EDIT---  Alright, now I have put some more hours in MGS5, time to edit my review..  I have sunk some hours in FOB raiding and defending.. In my opinion it gets old really fast. If you don't take the exact way the game wants you to go, you are screwed. This does not mean, that the infiltration is totally screwed, but it gets a lot harder. The events they hold currently are at least a way to enjoy this feature without the fear of retaliation and receive some bonus. Yet FOB invasions are the real only way to receive some soldiers who are not capped at S-rank.  The emblemcreation-problem was fixed shortly after I put up my review, but I was to lazy to edit it up until now. The serverconnection got a lot better, too. I am signed in as soon as the game starts, and even stay logged in D=  A new feature which was recently added is the almighty MGO (Metal Gear Online). It is free for everyone who bought the game!

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"OK, so let's talk here. As of this moment, I have played 31.9 hours total of Evolve, and I absolutely love every single moment. The balance between both monster and hunter is very good, the games won percentage is damn near even, the game itself is beautiful, and no one class is similar at all to the other. I have read many other reviews for this game, and quite a few people are complaining about day one DLC. I do not believe that this is a valid arguement for a negative review for this game at all. Most, if not all big box office games like Evolve have day one DLC, and most if not all have a season pass available for purchase. The DLC currently available is ALL cosmetic, and not at all in any shape or form game changing. There is no pay to win, nor content you cannot unlock simply by playing the game.  Now, as for cost? Let's look at the game as a MOBA title (which it is not, but for monetary purposes, let's look at it this way) Most MOBAs are free to play, but allow you to unlock gods, champions, heroes, etc., etc., for a nominal price of any where between 5 - 10 dollars. Now let's be generous. Let's say, we're paying 5 dollars per 'champion'. There are 5 classes total, Monster, Assault, Trapper, Support and Medic. Each roll has 3 current available characters that you progressively unlock as you play. So, that makes 15 characters. That's 75 dollars worth of content.  As for maps? There are about 7 - 9 of them, if I'm remembering currently... And each of them can have different weather effects, which make them even that much more interesting. I have read many reviews complaining about the lack of maps, but again, let's look at something like Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Call Of Duty (any of them), or any MOBA. You're generally playing the same maps over, and OVER, and OVER again. I feel like most people are looking to pick on the game with this complaint. The maps are beautiful, detailed, and the ecosystem that the devs put together is extremely intriguing (and tasty)  All in all, yes, this game is not for absolutely everyone. BUT, I do recommend it HIGHLY. If you have a friend who owns it, ask to play for a bit. Watch YouTube videos. Make an educated purchase, and this game will not steer you wrong. Happy hunting everyone.",1,0

The Multiplayer is really adictive, and it works really great, at least in my country (Spain) I have no problem finding games really quick, and I've played around 30 matches so far, none of them with a hint of lag, or high ping issues, and that's fantastic in this kind of game.  Other people is reporting problems with the Performance. I don't get it either... I'm running it with a couple of GTX660Ti, all maxed out, and 60 fps steady... 60% of the campaign already completed and no performance problems whatsoever.  The only negative point in my opinion is the lack of content so far. A few more maps would be nice, and even more missions for the coop mode.  8/10. I'm really enjoying it.",1,1

620,Portal 2,"Amazing. Just Amazing. This game is a HUGE step-up from the last game. It's longer which I love because that's the biggest flaw to me for the last game. It has a lot more achievements so I have a lot more to do in the game if the story isn't enough. And best of all, there is a co-op mode. That is the best part of Portal 2. Being able to play with a friend is awesome because it opens up a lot more possibilities for new tests. And those tests go to the community chamber part of Portal. I love being able to create your own test and sharing them with the world. And the story is much better in this than the origonal Portal. It shows the back story to Aperature Science and seeing your friend betray you and your enemie to help you instead of your 'friend' betraying you. Also the end of the game is really good and personally, they don't need to make a Portal 3. It ends so well that they could stop right here. I spent over 100 hours into this game and it's probably one of my favorite all time games. And, it's only what, $15? $20? I don't know. If you don't have this game, first what are you doing? But if you don't GO BUY IT! It's a huge cake and no, that isn't a lie. :)",1,0
247240,Volgarr the Viking,"Game is garbage. Developers need to stop designing games that test your patience and memory more than reflexes. I don't want to restart the second level thirty times because I haven't figured out all of the patterns in it yet. it's basically a dancing game like DDR, just learn the dumb patterns of the ruthless and annoying enemies. But you know what, I guess I'm just not hardcore enough for the game because I don't like restarting the same level until I have lost interest in playing the game and going through the same segments until they become dull obstacles that have lost all of their intenisty and challenge.",-1,0

The outcome is the same no matter how you play which is sad because if it were different than replays would be meaningful. played through 4 times choosing completely diferent dialog and although the dialog would change the end result is unmovable.2/5",1,0

204120,LEGO® Harry Potter: Years 5-7,"I cannot in good faith recommend this game. It has everything that all of the previous LEGO games have, but it also comes with its own problems. The main one is that it can be incredibly boring. A few of the missions just don't have anything going on with them. No enemies, no plot points, nothing. Then when the game realizes that you probably should have enemies, it spams you with them, so you literally have to stop everything you're doing every few seconds to beat them. It gets repetitive, and shows that the game developers don't realize that there's a big difference between challenging and annoying.   The makers of Candy Crush also have no idea what that line is, but whatever.   Also, all of the best LEGO games have humor, or, at the very least, characterize their characters pretty well. They're fun to watch. That is not the case with this one. I didn't really care about any of them.   Most of the levels feel like busywork instead of actual levels that advance the story. Heck, some of the levels in between the levels that weren't really levels were more interesting than the levels we got.   I'd say that, if the game got one more re-write for the story, it could have been a lot better. As it was, it had a few glaring problems. I'd say no to this one.",-1,0

302510,Ryse: Son of Rome,"Friends, Romans, countrymen lend me your ears.....  So, I've given this a fair few hours in both solo and multiplayer and feel I've seen enough to give a review.  The first thing to say is that the game does look pretty impressive; the level of detail found in the game assets and environments is wonderful to behold. The character models are good, the lip synching not too bad and the acting top notch for the most part. It's very much a cinematic experience. It's not going to win many awards for historical accuracy but on the whole you do get a compelling atmospheric version of ancient Rome. Presentation and menus are nice but navigating it is a bit clunky, You soon get used to it however.  The gameplay is fairly one dimensional and repetitive but that doesn't mean that it isn't fun, because it is! Essentially this is a third person hack and slash adventure where you block and hack away at an assortment of barbarians. It's fairly easy to pick up and keyboard/mouse is fine if you don't have a controller. Fighting is similar to the Batman games or Devil May Cry but perhaps a little more simplistic. You do get to do some impressive combos and it's quite satisfying chaining them all together. The executions are really quick-time events and it doesn't matter too much if you get them wrong as the end result is the same - dismembered barbarian! The animations for this are good but after a while you know which ones are coming. The campaign so far has kept me interested and there is a hint of the supernatural to the story. There are a number of artifacts/letters scattered about to find so there is a bit of a replay factor there. I'd recommend playing on one of the higher difficulties.  Multiplayer is more of the same but in an arena. It's actually pretty fun and there are four modes to mess about with, (although they are not all that different). There are some tasks to complete whilst running around the arena in your attempt to survive. The arenas are varied and are pretty cool as it all moves about. The multiplayer appears to only support two players, which is a shame as a four player arena experience could have been good fun. You do get to customize your fighter though through experience points and gold. Supporting one of four gods will also affect your experience in the arena.  On the whole it's an average game with above average visuals that's fun to play. I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price but if it's cheap in a steam sale, why not give it a go.  This game scores 7 out of 10",1,0

In scopee, the game offers more than any of us will ever see, and that is amazing once you start to play. From your starter planet, on, you start to realize that you will never see everything a planet has to offer. Then you finally launch into space, and once again you realize this. From pirate battles in space, to sentinels attacking you endlessly this game is both calming and a thrill.   Yes there are issues, but I am sure the team aat Hello Games are working on it, as is the case with every game now-a-days. But once all the bugs are worked out, this game will shine.

If you don't like rougelike games, where you lose all your progress if you die, then this game is not for you. If you do and up buying the game, then an example of your first run though might go as follows.  Get through the first few sectors without much difficulty Go to a nebula Find out your ship is on fire, but only once it's too late Burn to death  OR, it might go something like this  Start fighting a ship Ship blows up you oxygen tanks Rush to repair the oxygen, w/out oxygen to work with Suffocate  PERHAPS, you might, just might, by some miracle of RnGsus, make it to secter 8 in your first run through You'll get excited, because the final boss is coming up Go engage the final boss in battle Prodede to be utterly and completly ahnialated in the most unfair final boss since Dark Souls  If any of that appeals to you, try getting this game. In all seriousness though, this game is very fun. It's fun because it is challenging. If you have a friend who plays it, so much the better; one of the best things about this game is laughing about what happened to your ship with your friend. I should also say that the game isn't that harsh, once you get the hang of it, but the final boss doesn't get any easier.  Final rating: 10/10  Would burn in Nebula again.",1,0

It exudes swagger and charm with a pumping soundtrack that hits all the right notes along with strong voice acting and a varied cast of characters.   So far I've done a few of the story missions, it does indeed seem possible to fail and it's not a snooze fest at all, there is elements of positional strategy at play though it is not a tightly tuned endeavour that novices will have trouble picking up quickly which is refreshing.  The various characters are all very different in play style and function and the helix and loadout systems allow you to fine tune the way you play.   So far it's an enjoyable co-op gun-show that facilitates team play without any high end co-ordination required making it, so far, very light on toxic attitude.

383870,Firewatch,"I just finished the game and I loved every second of it. I even dare to say that it is the best game released ín 2016 so far. If you like a game with a great story, amazing atmosphere and some mystery involved, look no further because firewatch is the game for you. If you liked gone home you will definitly enjoy this game. Just like gone home firewatch's story isn't very long, it took me a little less than 4 hours to beat it. But for me it's not about the quantity of gameplay that matters, but the quality. The characters are interesting, likeable and easy to symphatize with. The dialouge between the main characters are extremely well written. This game may have a compact story but contains all the elements for a great game, and for all the people saying that this game is not worth the money due to its rather short story, it costs just a little more than a movie ticket but it last twice as long. I recomend this game for all the people who like slow paced but story rich games like gone home or any telltale game. Speaking of gome home, firewatch's soundtrack is written by Chris Remo who also wrote the soundtrack for gome home. Do NOT buy this game if you think constant action is a criteria for a good game and can't appreciate great dialouge, story and overall atmosphere.  TL;DR?

218620,PAYDAY 2,"This game is fun.  Its a sequal to the game called PAYDAY.  The entire concept with this game is that you play the part of a bank robber. You and your group and other playable characters are profesional bank robbers/thieves and have robbed many places. In this game you get missions that are banks and a plethora of other things to rob and do . You dont just rob banks, you rob trucks, and trains and a plethora of other places.  As you do this you get money and level up so to speak by getting better and differing equipment among other things also you gain skills which are useful in helping yourself and the other characters helping you.(these characters can be computer controlled or other players)  Anywise, alot of the reviews for this game have started becoming joke reviews....ie to quote a few...'bag throwing simulator' or 'I learned to throw bags inthis game and got a job in real life throwing bags too' etc.  The fact is yes there are times when you will throw bags of money, there are times when you wont. IN fact there are many other things to get besides money...like drugs for example...or items placed to help you.   The interesting thing about this game is that there are mutiple ways to play the game, from taking hostages to doing other things in the area...to playing with other players....to simply soloing.  The fact that there are many ways to play this game....and the fact the developers keep putting out new material...makes this game what i consider one the best types of games to get and to play.  Its not just he game play or graphics and sound....which are not too bad.........they are not super fantastic either....as i have played many games so i am a bit biased.  But the support you get is incredible....and the time and care the developers take to make this game....and the way they speak to the players.....not just arbitrarily doing things or ignoring the players....but actualy giving real information and asking what people think.  That is the sort of game people should play in my opinion...not becasue of the game type but becasue of the support and fun to be had by playing.  Although this same style can lead to many people feeling that its a bad thing....and then those people make up stories how they got alienated or some other outlandish thing....but if you look you will find those are a very small number of posts....and usualy by one player who frakily just doesnt like the game just because.....and they wont even be able to tell you specifc details...that only a person who has actualy played would know.  There is one small issue....and that is a few players you might play with....will cheat like crazy....it was rampant...but isnt anymore...as i assume players found its a heck of alot more fun to just not cheat.  So in the end....I recommend this game....i recommned it for people who like first person shooters....and to people who simply like the idea of playing a bank robber or genral thief....i also recommend this game to peopel with out alot of time who just simply want to jump into a game and shoot and have fun.",1,0

218620,PAYDAY 2,"I purchase Payday 1 and 2 both since their release. And just start actual Payday 2 gaming recently. This game looks very good at the first look. It's good to go loud and heist, good to sneak heist.  Somehow after like some hours stealth gaming with friends, I more and more reallize the very big issue of this game - the replication (data sync) mechanism of multiplayer gaming.  Payday 2 replicates attacking, player actions very good, it give you very good attack feedback when you are a client in a MP game.  But there is always a terrible delay of the player movement. I could see my friend run to me throwing me a bag from very far in my sight ,and the bag fell under my feet. This is because his position I see is actually the postion several seconds before. He's actually close to my postion right now. This is not a once or twice issue, this is a issue throughout the whole multiplayer gameplay, which means you have no idea where everyone is actually at. The player position you see are delay displayed.  In go louds, you have no idea where your teammates are going to do. Like in a escape. You see a guy in the back, you run back to him to help him. But he's actually catched up already, what you see is like 3 or 4 seconds ago. Then he see you in the back , he would go back to assit you. Then you both get killed. Or 3 people run to a drill postion, all start to drill because everyone see himself is the first one to get there.  Also, I think it might be a connected issue in multiplayer steath, client gamers are always so easy to be detected by guards. You think you already hide behind objects but the host doesn't know that, it still higher your detected level then you are busted. When I picked the stealth with my friend we didn't realize this ♥♥♥♥. We thought we were not skillful enough though before we switched turns to host and the other guy kept getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off by unreasonable detections. If you are the host or in a offline single gamer mode, you can always sneak like a bird that's ♥♥♥♥ing easy. You can slip through the guards and camera nothing happens.  But if you are a CLIENT GAMER, THERE IS NO FXXKING WAY YOU CAN SNEAK SMOOTHLY. Me and my friend use the same ISP , and we tried in the same LAN. Same issues.  Later I googled it and found another video at youtube, showing him and his friend even had different alert reasons. I don't know if this happened to us but there were several times both of us saw the other one of us caused the alert and we strongly argued over these. Also in his video, the character movement delay is very obvious. There are a lot complaints for years about this but the developers never fix this issue.  I don't know why so many people even level up to 100 for so many times. I get fully mad before I get to the first 100. I probrably would play single player only.",-1,0

Now I would be a liar if i said this game was perfect, it still has some bugs to work out mainly AI bugs, Word to the wise dont put your men on a wall during city battles unless you plan on keeping them there because they will react slowly to your orders 'if they even listen' and they tend to get confused when asking the to move to another part of the wall or maybe all my men are spawns of incest no offence to you spawns of incest but your probably not the sharpest tool in the shed anyway other then that the bugs are minor and its still a must play.   this game gets 4 happy pandas out of 5",1,0

15210,Silent Hunter III,"SH3 is one of those games that you need to invest time in. It is a perfect example of a 'Dad game,' as Yahtzee Crowshaw once put it. It's meticulously detailed, and you must learn all of the different eccentricities of the sub to be a great captain.  It uses the real-life technological limitations from WWII to define the gameplay. Want to fire off a torpedo? A standard gas-powered torpedo leaves a trail of bubbles in the water, which ships can detect in advance and will swerve to avoid your torpedo. You can fire an electric torpedo, but you'll need to be close, or else the battery in the torpedo will die and it won't reach your target. SH3 is filled with these sorts of tactical nuances that really make it satisfying to play.  Difficulty is customizable. It can be as simple as 'point the periscope at a target and shoot,' to manually identifying and anaylizing your target's position relative to your own. Difficulty is increased by making the game more akin to real life (limited air, limited fuel, no periscope stablilization, etc.) This helps tremendously, since beginners can relax the difficulty while they familiarize themselves with the ships' systems.  The player is awarded more renown following a mission with high difficulty, compared to a mission with a lower difficulty setting. Renown is SH3's version of experience points. It allows you to 'purchase' upgrades for your sub like improved batteries, hydrophones, conning towers, or even a completely different sub altogether. Medals are awarded after each mission, which you can assign to your crew. This is probably the single most satisfying part of the game; the medals allow your crew to function more efficiently, thus improving things like torpedo reload times.  There's a lot to cover here, so let me just wrap this this up by saying that this is probably the best simulation game I've ever played. I find myself coming back to it every couple of weeks. It's aged quite horribly, but I don't care, since the gameplay is just too good. Forget the sequels in this series, SH3 is the best.",1,1

383870,Firewatch,"At the full price, no, I would not recommending buying this game.  First of all, it was a wonderful story. The narration between the two characters, including all the backstory that is revealed felt like reading a good book.  The game was everything I expected. It was very professionally done, no major glitches with a clean release. It was a nice adventure/story game.  The downer to me came when I completed the game in 3 hours. While I did not catch every easter egg, I did explore the whole map, all the boxes and took my time taking various routes on the map. The bottom line, for me, is $20 for 3 hours just isn't worth it to me. Had this game been priced at $5 or $10, I would have been more than happy with a positive review.  The worst part was that at the 3 hour point, it falls just outside the time limit for a steam refund. It is almost maddening to know that maybe if I hurried the story along quicker, I could have beaten the game in full AND recieved a steam refund!",-1,1

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"This is a hard game to review. The game itself is the arguably the best in the series. Every inch is packed with so much detail and you feel so powerful as Batman. Technically... it's a mess. Crashes are common as are framerate drops and for some reason vsync drops your fps cap by about 10 frames, so capping it to 30fps with vsync enabled gives you a cap of about 22fps??? Also the keyboard remapping is poor, so just use a controller.   So if you have a controller and don't mind the framerate dropping to the low 20's, buy it on special.  In other words: Kudos to Rocksteady for another awesome Arkham game and ♥♥♥♥ the people who made this poor ♥♥♥ port.",-1,0

35450,Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2 Multiplayer,"The most realistic WW2 FPS out there. Also it's one of the most fun. A must buy if you love tactical shooters or squad based FPS games. However, there is one thing that would make most gamers hate this. That is the realism. It's extremely in-depth, from the battles and locations to the weapon ballistics and overall feel of the game. It makes you catious and wary in firefights and tactical and quick when setting up for one.   Another great thing about this game is it's brutality. I don't just mean difficulty, I mean it's superb visuals. If you're with a group of friends, don't be suprised if they explode in front of you, leaving you to bleed out because some piece of shrapnel pierced your sternum. It's ok though, you'll respawn.

Quests are standard run of the mill kill x rats, gather x berries, etc. Crafting is a boring grind. The staggering amount of things you have to pay for is insane. Worst example I saw in the short time I played was in order to queue up crafting jobs (ex: smelt all your copper ore) you have to buy a consumable item. That lets you craft 10 items at a time, once. Free to play has such massive potential for great consumer experiences (see Path of Exile), but if developers keep putting in blatant money grabs like this that only hinder gameplay, it will continue to have the terrible reputation that it does.",-1,0

377160,Fallout 4,"I've tried to like this game and lord knows I've played the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. The problem is that it's not fallout 3 or fallout new vegas. Instead it more and more feels like a hollowed out verision of what someone thought fallout should be. The game is fun to explore and the combat is fun but once you've done something once there's little reason to go back and do it again. The game is so caught up on settlement building that things like proper factioins, back stories, meaniful quests, and interesting characters get tossed out the window. Bethesda had a chance to fix these problems with the DLC and at first it truly looked like they listened. Far harbor got it right and then they announced more settlment DLC with only one other story DLC before calling it quits. It feels like my favorite video game series has hit it's twilight. The game is good but it should have been so much better. In the end Fallout 4 feels like a game that should have been great on par with fallout 3 or close to it. Instead we got a game where they tried and failed to put the effort in to make it shine.",-1,1

292410,Street Racing Syndicate,"  Played it a few years ago, while the NFSU hype was on.  - Graphics are good. - Gameplay is arcade-ish, fun and addictive. - Not much customization compared to NFSU1/2.  - Feels like a cheaper Most Wanted; but pretty decent overall.  I'd recommend it if you like a good no-brain, night themed racing game, but 10$ sounds like a bit much to me.   It has trading cards btw.",1,0

Basically, a letter you wrote, which comes from the title of the game.  If you enjoyed Gone Home, or games like it, you will surely enjoy this game.

If you're thinking about buying it solely for its combat aspect, however, I should add that the combat isn't really there for a thrill of the fight, though some fights may have you on the edge of your seat anyhow.

24980,Mass Effect 2 (2010),"Warning, some spoilers.   You played ME 1 before looking at this, right? If not, go back and get ME1 right now and play it.   OK.   This game takes everything good about ME1, and makes it better. Then it takes the few downsides of ME1 and completely revamps them.   Combat is an order of magnitude better; it feels almost like Halo or Battlefield. You can now interrupt villainous monologues instead of MST3King them as they play on your headset. You can give Tali a cooldown hug, trade witty banter with Garrus, and listen to Jack spew profanity.   Oh, and you can kill a freaking thresher maw with a pistol if you're really good.   Shepard is back, and she (come on, admit it, you played FemShep because MaleShep's voice was unintelligible and you couldn't bring yourself to abandon your beloved character for a new incarnation in ME2) is more badass than ever. She can punch a mecha to death with her bare hands, kill krogan berserkers with a handgun, kill a freaking Reaper with an assault rifle, and repeatedly prove that no matter how much Harbinger rants he is no match for Shepard.   Shepard's friends are...mostly back. Wrex is basically the krogan king, so your Big Guy is Grunt--think adolescent Wrex, or in other words pure testosterone backed up by brute force. Garrus is Space Batman. Tali is all grown up and in charge of awesome missions of her own. Ashley won't talk to you because of the Cerberus thing, but that's OK because at least she's been promoted a bit. Liara is a badass information broker and femme fatale of sorts, and if you don't have Lair of the Shadow Broker buy it as soon as you get this game because it is the best freaking DLC and it exists to reinforce what a badass Shepard is and how badass all her buddies are.   Shep's new friends are...pretty cool. There's Miranda, the arrogant jerk with a ridiculously sculpted body and a skintight catsuit, who becomes slightly less of a jerk over the course of the game; Jacob, the career soldier who at least has his ♥♥♥♥ together; Grunt, who's basically testosterone incarnate; Thane, who's badass; Jack, who's ♥♥♥♥ed up in the head and wears tatoos and little else; Samara, who's a space paladin with...um, lots of cleavage. Looooooooots of cleavage. And then there's the BEST CHARACTERS EVER:   1. Doctor Mordin Solus, who is the best because he:  -offers practical sex advice and doesn't judge -blinks upwards -omits pronouns and this is awesome -is a scientist and science is cool -Sets bad guys on fire -Is the very model of a scientist salarian -and has a cool neck thingy.   and, 2. Legion, who is a geth, and is awesome, and I refuse to hear a word against Legion.   Pros:  +DLC is great, get it all.  +Combat MUCH improved from ME1.  +Soundtrack even more epic.  +Story and characters still awesome.  +Harbinger is best villain.  +Mordin Solus.  +Liara's character development.  +Mordin Solus.  +Grunt in general is great.  +Mordin Solus.  +Legion.  +Mordin Solus.  +The final mission, beyond awesome.  +Mordin Solus.  +Garrus's recruitment mission.  +Garrus in general.  +Mordin Solus.  +Niftu Cal, BIOTIC GOD!  +Mordin Solus.  +Cooldown hug for Tali, best little moment I've seen in a game in a long time.  +Kal'Reegar, great bit character.  +Aria in general.  +Mordin ♥♥♥♥ing Solus.  +Vanguard revamps make it the best class.  +You can shoot a guy while he's in the middle of an evil rant. This is awesome.  +And, last but not least, Mordin Solus. He cannot be emphasized enough.   Cons:  -Still cannot romance Wrex.  -Cannot take up the mating offer you get from a krogan on Tuchanka if you beat the thresher maw.  -Cannot punch out Miranda when she acts really jerkish.  -Jack is a sort of flat and superfluous character, and you already have some decent biotics early-game, so ehhh.   11/10 would assume direct control again.",1,0

23490,Tropico 3 - Steam Special Edition,"At first glance, I thought this was going to be a generic city builder with the superficial fluff of playing a dictator to add a few laughs. However, Tropico 3 plays less like a city builder and more like a political simulator. Buildings aren't built to make money for more buildings or to create a better life for your citizens. No, buildings are built only to please the various factions and citizens of Tropico so fewer people consider having El Presidente retire to an 'undisclosed location'. The dictator context is mined for its laughs though and the game uses that sense of humor and a very helpful radio show to establish an instant sense of immersion which falls apart entirely when its variety is quickly exhasted. These extras go from endearing to repetitive all the way to obnoxious in the space of two or three missions. Character creation is where this lack of variety is the most glaring. There is a reasonably wide selection of appearances and traits to choose from, allowing for a real custom character. But with the text of those traits and the introduction of the missions being so specific, the character you've crafted floats away in the contradictions. This is not helped by the fact that El Presidente only has two sound sets, male and female, with the female being so cringe-worthy I only used it once. It is also worth mentioning that, as of the writing of this review, the 'Special Steam Edition' is thoroughly un-Steam. No Steam Achievements, No Trading Cards, No Cloud Saves. Nothing to indicate that this is a Steam game past the title. It doesn't change the way the game is played and Tropico 3 does have in game achievements to scratch that itch, but the lack of Steam features on a game so named seems a little strange. Complaints aside, I enjoyed playing this game, but I don't have plans to come back to it anytime soon. I recommend giving it go, but maybe play through the demo a few times before dropping any money on it.",1,0

Mid-end game combat ends up a walk in the park, and so I found the only tense moments are in the first dozen turns...and the diplomacy system is laughable - just 'war' or 'not war'. Where's the tech exchange? Treaties? Backstabbings? Alliances? Trade? Nope just that on or off switch...  When only 0.7% of players have had their homeworld attacked, you know something's gone wrong.

373920,Eisenhorn: XENOS,"Action-adventure game with combo-button mashing combat system like Mad Max, Shadow of Mordor, and Batman Arkham Games. Gameplay very similar to Batman: Arkham Asylum, but a tad less polished (and you're not Batman, obviously).  Story is great. Voice acting by Mark Strong...so it's amazing. I'm enjoying this game for the environment alone as it really captures the locale of Warhammer 40K. Uses Unreal 3 engine (so things are shiny), graphics leave much to be desired on the PC, but this was originally an iOS only game, so I'm glad they released this for PC. This is very console-y experience and best played with a controller. I'm using my Steam Controller and it works great. If this was a AAA title, I would be disappointed, but for $14, this is a great game. And if you like playing Rogue Trader or Dark Heresy RPGs, I'd almost say this is a must buy while it's on sale.  So far, I've only played about a few hours, but already it is a nice fun button masher with stunning visuals of Warhammer 40K universe. A deep in depth game, this is not. But you're basically playing your way through a Dan Abnett 40K novel, so that's okay by me. If you're looking for a $60 Eisenhorn version of Arkham City, this isn't it. I see a lot of bellyaching in the reviews and on the forums and seriously, get over it folks. This is a game that is literally cheaper than a movie. If it had come out 5 years ago, it would be tops. But it didn't it came out for mobile platforms in 2016. I, for one, am glad they released it on PC so I can use my controller. Can't imagine playing this on my phone/tablet.  The combat system is a little sluggish compared to some of those other games I mentioned above, but I'm guessing the whole “can be played on iOS device” might be the culprit there. Also the allied AI in the combat is dumb as a box of rocks.   Still recommend as it pretty much just lets you play your way through a Dan Abnett 40K novel. The story, environments, and voice acting are where this game really shines. I can't wait until the next 2!! ",1,0

A lot of masterpiece games (Witcher 3, Life is Strange, and now Tales of Borderland). This one I think the coolest game telltale ever made. (played most of them: game of thrones, tales of monkey island, the wolf among us, walking dead 1-2, jurassic park, sam &amp; max season 1).  Loved the intros in each episode (where title is shown). Especially in episode 2. It's most epic game start I've ever seen.  'Tales of Borderlands' - is essence of 'Mad Max Fury Road' movie, Quentin Tarantino dialogs and situations, wild west, science fiction (like star wars or mass effect).  Should say that wasn't familiar with Borderlands universe before. The start of first episode was a little boring, but when you begin to know characters better the game is flourishing.  Amazing selection of music tracks, outstanding art (a lot of different locations), crazy dialogs and really good jokes (lots of them), many cool characters.

230230,Divinity: Original Sin (Classic),"I am not often writing recommendations, but for this gem I got to. Larian Studios have done a fantastic job in bringing out a game true to the golden age of CRPG. What you get with Divinity Original Sin is a mix of Baldur's Gate and the original Fallout. Attention to detail is fantastic, although the text elements might sometimes get a bit too heavy for some of you. The combat system is dead on right for me, with a good mix of tactical elements, decision making and choices on how to best approach an enemy. The story is deep and you have plenty of well designed side quests to keep you happy four countless hours. I have the habbit of taking it slow and explore every corner of the enviroment and I can tell you, it is a blast exploring in this beautifully crafted world. Divinity gives you various options on how to approach quests or areas and you are not necessarily bound to have specific character classes with you in order to solve or explore specific areas. In most group RPGs I try to have at least one rouge class character with me (although I do not necessarily prefer it), just to be able to open every chest or get into every location. Larian Studios has managed to prvide access to many areas or access to various situations without depending too much on specific character classes. Just to give you one example, I was surprised to find out that after using my rouge to unlock a door to an abandoned house I desperately wanted to get into, I could have broken down the door with a character that had enough strength or, after managing to get in, I saw that there was another secret entrance through a well in the countryside. Allaround a well designed game!",1,0

400160,Concrete Jungle,"A fun little arcadey puzzle/strategy game that feels like a board game.    https://youtu.be/o8RMubD5UmM    The gameplay revolves around developing a city column by column. This is done by placing buildings that gather points (Houses) and then to boost those with the help of buff buildings like schools and shops. At the sametime you'll have to be carefull about placing buildings that hamper the living quality of the city, like factorys or even supermarkets, even though they give buffs they can also ruining another area at the same time.  Well just don't place buildings that are negative rigth? And were would the fun be in that? For chalenges sake and because well.. you have to place them as the buildings arent placed like in Cities Skylines or in a RTS game were you can freely decide where and what to place.  Instead the game gives you one or two choices of buildings in the form of cards and aat somepoint you'r gonna have to plonk some factorys down in the middle of happy family suburb.  As you progress the game you can unlock different cards and skills to make you'r concrete jungle more diverse.  Art style is quite nice and it's niceto look at. Graphically you can expect mobile game style graphics, so be wary of that.  In my opinion the game would probably do better on the mobile markets then on Steam, but hey go ahead and give it a shot Mr dev.  In short it's not a bad game but for Pc audiences, not sure if there's enough to it.

296490,GemCraft - Chasing Shadows,"Well, Well, Well. Gemcraft you have become an Executable, and a £4.99 executable at that, which for many of the series followers is a giant betrayal, i am a game designer with a degree in Games Design so i can understand why they made it a pay only game unlike all 4 or 5 previous gemcraft games which By the way if im doing a review im going to be brutally honest.   Gameplay - well rest assured this game lives up to the previous Gemcraft games being the next in the series with the story following the same format as the previous games, the evil darkness is trying to get hold of your spirit forge and you need to stop her (i say her, because it clearly states the 'Evil shadows' are female [possible spoiler]).   game play is very similar to the other games however the biggest difference is there are now 2 new gems, the Black and the White, although the previous games didnt have these gem colours their effects were in the games, if i can remember correctly the Black gem is what the Red gem used to be it will get more powerfull the more it hits an enemy, and the white Gem gets more powerfull the more you upgrade your manapool. i will say that the previous gemcraft game gemcraft the labrinth was amazing, and if 'game in a bottle' make a new game similar and make it cost £4.99 then it should damn well succeed where the others didnt, the map should be 2 or 3 times bigger with more to do on each level.  although there is alot to do in each level theres not as many levels or at least it doesnt feel as if there is. The world map is a grid sytem each tile on the grid is a letter of the alphabet with probably 4 maybe 5 levels in each tile, so there are a lot of levels which is good :) but... for a game that used to be a flash game on the internet i was expecting alot more from an executable that now costs £4.99.  All in all Still the best Tower Deffence Game out there im just dissapointed that there wasnt more new content that the other free games already did.  Verdict - The game is still very good and i still play it even though ive completed all levels, if you cant bring yourself to pay for the game my advice is go online and play gemcraft: Labrinth for free then if you like that one finish it and buy this new one. it is still worth it, and you never know they might rectify the price sometime down the line :)",1,0

401890,ARSLAN: THE WARRIORS OF LEGEND,"I always loved DW games, but this spin off is quite a pleasent surprise, you have all the whistles of dw, with an hybrid rpgesque lvling system and equipment , in this case called Skill Cards . The combat is very fluid , very dynamic, and have an adition of a infinite combo system, that if you know what your doing you can chain attacks forever!   Technically , KT finally listened and the game can run at 4k, provide your system can run it, and the graphics are beautifull, run at 60 fps , but it have a 30 fps lock on mid-battles cutscenes for when you destroy a barrier with the cavalry, but they are fast animations and dont distract you from the action, you would only notice that if you run with a fps counter. The transition to in-game engine from anime cutscenes is pretty well done too!  Heard AMD can have drops in fps, i run on Nvidia and didnt had any fps drops was solid 60 all the time.  All in all, its worth its price, lots of fun, and a must have for Musou fans :)",1,1

I was looking for strategy-based FPS by a few months. Rainbow Six Siege is great. Destroyable environment and many mechanics [like breaching through walls or rappeling] adds to this FPS a lot of strategic possibilities. Difference between Standard and Starter Edition isn't painfull at all; it requires more time to spent on collecting all Operators. Graphics are nice, sound very realistic, shooting needs some practise for each weapon, every map has it's own key-spots. Greatly optimalised, 41 stable frames on Ultra settings [RADEON R7 370 4GB]. I've never seen better community, 90% of players are mature, friendly and helpfull. But... The best way to play this game is to play with a team. Communication, synchronisation and strategy are keys to victory. Great game and I don't regret. I hope it'll take my whole holidays.",1,0

428370,Windlands,The good: -Sense of speed and momentum -level design -art style -sound track -sense of scale -the crippling fear of the first jump -skill ceiling -Fear of failing  The ok: -Controls  -use of room scale -replayability  The bad -Motion sickness -no level editor -no mods -Collistions  The good in depth.  This game manages to recreate the feeling of swinging across the world like spiderman and that alone is enough to recomend this game. The sense of speed is unlike anything I have experienced in VR and an understanding of momentum is key. This game takes skill to master but is fairly easy to get the hang of making for some fantastic possibilities and the level design makes sure you have many many ways to reach your destination. All this tied together with a wonderful soundtrack and a windwaker like artstyle makes this game stand out from the others available. The sense of scale is crazy. Looking up at my destination saying to myself 'F*ck thats going to be fun to jump off of' only came once I felt comfortable taking leaps of faith. Often times without thinking its possible to string together an impressive path through the landscape and it rewards you for finding interesting pathways around the level. These aspects make this game absoloutly worth picking up if you don't suffer from VR sickness.  The ok in depth.  The controles work but need to be customizeable. I didn't like the quick snap turn and found it akward to use the grip buttons to jump. The problem was the only other options for the controler setup took away your ability to control how your grappling hooks worked so I was forced to deal with it. Coupple this with a broken trackpad and the controles had a bit to be desired for. The use of roomscale is next to nonexistant but it doesn't really hinder the enjoyment of the game.  The bad in depth.  You cannot play this game if you get sick easy. I am one of few peaople who don't get nausa playing these types of games. I imagine if you werent so lucky your lunch would be on the floor in moments of playtime. The collistion sucks because it tracks the collitions from the center of your play area. This means if you somehow driffted to the left or right to much what is under your feet may just clip through you because the center of your room is where your 'VR Legs' are. This means you have to stay in the center of your room lest you make the platforming way more difficult. The fact that there is no level editor or mods isn't really a horrible horrible thing but I desperatly want more of this game. I want to make my own playground to screw around in. Maybe even multiplayer introducing races or something to give the game a bit more length. The game is somewhat short but thats not a bad thing because its a sweet game. It doesn't overstay its welcome.  All in all if you don't suffer from motionsickness I recomend this game. Its fantastic   ,1,0

239800,Bleed,"My advice is to play the game on easy, then after completing it move to normal, then hard, etc. All your upgrades carry over which makes replaying it feel more progressive. Speaking of that, after completing easy mode i instantly dived into normal and beat that too. Nowadays i usually never replay games so soon, but this game made me *want* to play it again.   It does take some time to get used to the controls, and i still wish there was multiple controller options (like , X to shoot, A to jump and RB to double/triple/dash) but this game is really, really well done.

50300,Spec Ops: The Line,"Don't buy into the ridiculous bandwagon everyone jumps on for this game. They say that the storyline makes all of this worth playing, they're wrong. 'Oh the main character deteriorates throughout the game, SO DEEP!' 'Oh they really stick it to those CoD games and shows how bad war really is YEAH!' There are a million games out there with a protagonist that develops, a million other games that portray war as anything but glorious (Even CoD 4 does this in many places) These alternative games also play far better than this one.   The level design is dull, combat is just horrible, and the storyline and its oh-so-amazing 'twist' was the most disappointing thing I think I've ever seen coming from just how much people worship it. If you're wanting the next great thing, skip this game, but if you're that curious, then at the very least wait for a sale. I can honestly not express how dull this game is, I won't spoil anything but I'll just say that the whole point the story tries to prove is just moot when the game behind it is a corridor shooter with absolutely no freedom whatsoever.",-1,0

200960,Geneforge 1,"  “… she stares up at you with awe, as if her god has stepped down to earth to face her. Maybe it has.”    Geneforge is a great turn-based role-playing game experience with a deep and meaningful story in combination with a unique take on magic. What it lacks in graphics it gains twofold in detailed descriptions of events throughout the game.   Your decisions have major impact on the game’s conclusion and gameplay is vastly different depending on which of the three classes you choose.   The almost total lack of music and no voice acting should be mentioned as the disadvantages of this classic RPG.    Trivia:    The attempt of futuristic weapons with devastating effects that simultaneously felt sensible and maintained balance were one of the most difficult gameplay issues the developers had to resolve.    Achievements:    The game has no Steam achievements.    Chronology:    Geneforge 5: Overthrow (PC) Classic turn-based role-playing game  (Fantasy + Science Fiction) – 2009   Geneforge 4: Rebellion (PC) Classic turn-based role-playing game  (Fantasy + Science Fiction) – 2007  Geneforge 3 (PC) Classic turn-based role-playing game  (Fantasy + Science Fiction) – 2005  Geneforge 2 (PC) Classic turn-based role-playing game (Fantasy + Science Fiction) – 2003  Geneforge (PC) Classic turn-based role-playing game (Fantasy + Science Fiction) – 2002",1,1

241560,The Crew,"First things first, most of the poor reviews for this game are from hardcore racing game fans. this review is from the point of view of someone who has almost never played a racing game before. with that said, i can safely say that the crew is actually a pretty good game.   The story is a little short with me having beat the campaign in a little under 18 hours (over the cource of about 5 days with ocasional side quests to level up my cars a bit before the next race), however the game offers some replay value in that you can go back to any mission you have done and replay it, though the rewards dont change for beating it at a higher level unless you've reached level 50 and unlocked platinum parts, in which case its worth going back and re-doing some missions.  The 'skills' are a touch annoying in that if you accidentaly trigger one while driving about you either need to open your phone and choose abort, open the map to auto abort it, or just let it time out. The game also claims to be MMO, but i played the entire campaign in solo mode because i couldnt find anyone to coop with, instead just getting an error that coop failed because there is no one in my session and in general only actually passing other players on the road a coupple of times every so often.  In general, i did enjoy the story and the game as a whole and ill continue to play it to complete the challenges, skills and the factions missions you unlock after reaching new york. If you havnt played any racing games before, this is quite a good one to start with, BUT i would not reccomend buying this at full price. wait for a sale and get it then.  i will say that i haven't noticed any problems with 'rubber banding AI' or undestructable cops, but thats just me and i also haven't had the game crash on me (yet)",1,0

332200,Axiom Verge,"I originally got this game thinking it was a fun Metroid clone. But that label does an injustice for what the game presents. There is an unbelievable amount of items and powerups packed into this game, and thats not even bringing up the most unique thing about this game: glitching the world! That concept really enhances the game experience and presents a new set of challenges and strategies that your basic Metroid clone would lack. It also is paced very well, starting you off nice and slow, but really pushing you come the end when you get more powerful. Even on the easiest difficulty, playing careless will result in death. Doubly true for bosses, which all present difficult but fair challenges. However, a few bosses can be defeated using cheap tricks.  The story knows its place is on the backburner, because the thing that sells this game is the adventure and action. So it is generally not intrusive. And the backstory is revealed only through certain pickups. But it does have some interesting ways of reintroducing itself, ways that you will definitely not see coming. The story isnt anything special, but it was not lazily written by any means.  Overall, Axiom Verge is one of the best games I've played on Steam. And thanks to item percentages, multiple endings, and even a speedrun mode for those who enjoy that challenge, there is replay value there. Whether you get it on sale or not, it is worth the price tag, without question. This game is not just some Metroid clone, its takes that label and glitches it into oblivion.",1,0

I would suggest playing with friends who you can privately invite and host games with to stop desync from ruining all multiplayer games but exculding that I think most of the negative reveiws are a bit too harsh. Fix desync error and it will be a great game, it's not like multiplaer worked well on the old disc versions anyway.",1,0

It captures the 80's future si-fi movie perfectly. The story, the soundtrack are all reminiscent of the 80's. This game has amazing gunplay and sounds and is very much like FarCry 3 but a bit watered down. The story isn't as long, there isn't as many weapons and attachments. The vehicle and wildlife scene are about the same just a bit less diverse. The exploration feels as good as FarCry3, which means that enviroments feel generally the same but different simultaneously. The whole game flows together and never breaks inmmersion. This game needs a fully fledged out sequel!",1,0

23490,Tropico 3 - Steam Special Edition,"City building games have been a staple of PC gaming since the beginning. It is a subset of the RTS genre that helped to pioneer both sandbox gameplay and the concept of nearly limitless replayability. Fastforward to the present and the genre remains very much alive and well in Tropico 3; a game that takes the foundation of the genre, adds a great deal of social and economic depth, and finally puts a Latin twist on it for good measure. Developed by Haemimont Games and published by Kalypso Media, Tropico 3 has all the features of a city-building game developed by the mainstream likes of Electronic Arts.  The first thing that will grab your attention is the visual quality. Tropico 3 brings the beauty of tropical islands to life very similar to the way Far Cry did. From lush forests to arid deserts, the varying environments on a single island help to break up any visual monotony that would normally be a problem. Of course, this isn't to say that the random map generator can't and doesn't create maps with little variation. Thankfully, the game does allow you to preview the landscape before starting on a new island.  If the visuals aren't impressive enough, the soundtrack will get certainly get your attention. The music attempts to capture the authentic Caribbean style and does a fairly good job of it. In fact, the only real downside to the soundtrack is that there doesn't seem to be enough tracks. You will hear the same tracks many, many times during one game, which can last for hours depending on whether you're playing in sandbox mode or a campaign.  In order to maintain the game's authenticity, the majority of the voice acting is Spanish. Moreover, any immigrants or workers hired from other countries will mostly speak English. Only the voice acting that the player needs to understand is done in English with a decent Latin American accent. For example, there is a radio announcer that provides regular updates on the situation of the island.  The gameplay isn't the standard city building players have come to expect from games like Sim City. Instead, Tropico 3's focus is on the social, political, and economic development of the island nation. The game introduces a few factions that the people align themselves with such as Capitalists, Communists, Nationalists, Militarists, Environmentalists, Intellectuals, and the Religious. And, the player is tasked with appeasing these factions whether by building structures such as churches or military bases, signing edicts that reduce pollution or ban contraceptives, or signing treaties with either the U.S. or the U.S.S.R.  The faction system brings a lot of depth to Tropico 3, and it isn't just about increasing the happiness of the overall population. Every couple years an election is held on the island that the player must win. Appeasing a majority of the factions helps secure votes, but it's based on more than making all the factions happy. For example, a majority of the population may belong to a single faction, thus making that faction the most important focus. Knowing which factions to appease and when is crucial to getting reelected. The player can choose to give political speeches during each election, and even pick what topics to address, which can have an effect on the voters.  The elections aren't the only thing to worry about it. There is also the potential for members of a faction to become rebels. If the player makes a faction angry enough, it will increase the number of rebels. Then, those rebels will attempt to sabotage infrastructure, take hostages, spread propaganda, and even assassinate El Presidente. Of course, being in good standing with the Militarists (the army) allows the player to fend off against rebel attacks, which even play out on the streets when they occur.  Economically, Tropico 3 is based entirely around three major sources of revenue: industry, agriculture, and tourism. The player can use farms, which can be set to harvest a variety of crops from food to tobacco; industrial buildings, which take those crops and produce products; and/or tourism attractions, which bring people to the island who will spend money.  Based on the map the player is given, some economic resources such as oil wells and mining deposits, may not be available, forcing the player to rely on other ways of growing the economy. Economic progression in Tropico 3 is a slow process, even using the 3x speed feature that's available. Moreover, it needs to be closely watched by the player because of random events that may occur. For example, throughout the game, the state of the world economy may fluctuate, causing an increase or decrease in the price of your exported goods. These events will impact the player's economy dramatically, forcing the player to take action.  Tropico 3 doesn't offer a huge number of building variations or options like many city building games do, but it doesn't need to. The depth of the game doesn't stem from the cosmetic look of the buildings, but from the dizzying level of depth and customization. For example, all the farms look exactly the same, but the player can set each farm on the island to grow a different crop. Better yet, where the farm is placed affects what types of crops it can grow. Some crops grow best at high altitudes, in high humidity, or in sunny areas. Picking the right crop for the right location can make or break your economy.  To add to the depth, the player can also set the wages of the workers based on the job or education level. Even better than that, players can set wages based on each individual building. For instance, the cooks at one restaurant could make $15 while the cooks at the restaurant close to the tourist's hotel could make $20. Players are also able to easily set the wages of all the cooks, regardless of which restaurant they work at, as simply as clicking a button. The same thing goes for the education level options, which allow the player to set the wage of all employees with no education, a high school education, or a college education.  Player will have to deal with a variety of problems such as pollution, economic disparity, crime, housing, political unrest, foreign influence, overcrowding, extreme weather, and a variety of random events that can impact the island. Hurricanes can sweep in and destroy key buildings such as electric substations, which could create rolling blackouts across the island, reducing the output of industry buildings that require power and lowering the overall happiness of the population.  Despite the game's astounding level of depth and options, however, there are a few problems that can cause headaches. For starters, the in-game tutorial is a less-than-adequate introduction to the game mechanics. It does a fine job of getting the player used to the UI and where certain information is represented, but it doesn't explain how to actually grow the economy or reduce the threat of rebellion. For example, the tutorial will tell the player how to build a farm and set a crop, but it doesn't make it clear how exactly it contributes to increasing revenue.  There are also some minor control issues. For example, when selecting a building to place on the map, the player uses the middle scroll wheel to rotate the buildings orientation. However, the scroll wheel is also used to zoom in and out, which means the player needs to zoom in close enough prior to selecting a building to ensure the placement is correct.  Overall, Tropico 3 should be applauded for its depth and customization. The game's visuals along with its unique and authentic soundtrack help draw the player into its Caribbean setting. And, regardless of its few problems, none of which are game-breaking, it does an excellent job of focusing on the political, social, and economic pieces of the game, each of which often affects the others in some way.",1,1

399430,Tinboy,"There is not much to say about this game. This is by far the most boring game I have played in a while. Even though there are some challening levels, some of them are stupidly hard just because the gameplay is absolutely trash. I mean.. sure, game costs just a dollar/euro, even lower when on sale, and it has trading cards, but it simply doesn't make up for the quality of this game. It's not the worst game I have ever played, it's just too basic for a platformer. Uninteresting repetitive level design, almost every level just about the same. Only thing that could save this dull experience would be a great soundtrack. But I think you've already guessed it - it's gruesome. Overall, I don't recommend you to buy this game at full price (even though it's just a dollar/euro) and since it seems like a small project/game, I doubt it will ever get updated with some better controls or/and levels, so don't get your hopes up.

My first impression was horrible.. it has that really gloomy dark air about it, the main character is not very attractive (both physically and mentally). Then there's this mysterious old lady called Queen of Maggots appearing out of nowhere and offered something too hard for reason to accept. There's not much you can do in game basically walking around and interact with objects and it really is creepy. I felt anxious, I didn't know what to expect.   By the time I finished this game I find it simply beautiful. The beauty of this game is not explicit; it lies within! Despite having flaws here and there (I had problem launching it and there's the maximum save file issue) I really liked it. The story is rather immersive and interesting, good character definition and almost everything in it is negative in nature (hence the age restriction). I never really looked into something negative as depression and suicide, this game offered me just that.   Recommended :)",1,0

It then abruptly ended, at which point I discovered I had not actually purchased a whole game, I'd only purchased half of one. This is a real shame; I wanted to support a great game design team, play a good game, and I even threw in the extra for the soundtrack because I thought 'This team has a vision, and I want to get behind a work of art.' I wasted $18 on half a game and I haven't got a clue where I can claim my soundtrack. I think Tim Schafer should be ashamed to fool people into buying something that isn't complete and then charge them an in-app purchase to play the rest of the game. It's underhanded, sleezy, and I'm not going to be buying from Double Fine or any other company with Tim Schafer's name on it again.  TLDR: Great hour of a game, wouldn't pay 18 bucks for an hour of gameplay though. Super mad that they are charging for the rest of the game, should have charged the price for the whole thing upfront.",-1,0

227940,Heroes & Generals,"(Edited as I wanted to put the review in more depth) Okay, so I've played Heroes and Generals for some time now. I really like the concept of the game, though it has its flaws.  Things it did right:  - The game. The game itself is a wonderful concept that has been made to the liking of many players.  - The guns. You can play as you want. You can buy a semi-auto or an auto rifle depending on your playstyle and upgrade it to your liking  - The modes. There are three main modes of play in Heroes and Generals: Assault, War and Skirmish. Each has its own difficulties and tactics.  Things it did wrong:  - Anti-cheat. This flaw is blatantly obvious, and can be noticed withing 10 or so games. There are a few main types of cheating in this: Wall hacking (Where the player can see other players through the walls), Aimbotting (The cursor tracks players), and XP / credit farming (where one player lets another get a LOT of kills on them, to farm XP and credits).  - Currency. This is well thought out in most places, but when the cost to repair your sniper rifle is more (Per shot) than you gain from a kill, it becomes an issue and you just end up waisting money.  - The players. Most team-mates dont actually care about winning the game or the objective. To them it is more of a CS:GO type of game than it is a strategy, which is what this game tries so hard to be, most players will either be absolutley terrible (Which I can understand, but the matchmaking levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold) should be sorted out) or they will be trolls and team kill or greif.  - Grenades... Oh boy, this one pisses me off. Grenades are not only the most over-powered pieces of ♥♥♥♥ in the game, but you can carry 3 per item slot (Meaning that a normal player can carry a max of 9 with no gun). Players seem to find it enjoyable that you can just throw these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s one after another until you kill the player you are trying to kill. I find this extremely stupid, as not only do these cost more to use than you get per kill, but RETO enforces the idea of using them.   RETO complains about losing money, but they only really have themselves to blame. You need to listen to your players. Think about adding / changing:  - The amount of carriable grenades  - The cost of repairs on certain weapons (As the recon class is now useless)  - An actually somewhat useful anti-cheat system  Aside from that little rant... love the game... would recommend..",1,0

92220,GundeadliGne,"Genre: Horizontal, bullet hell type of shmup  Introduction: This is a unique shmup, but not made for everyone. That because of the anime style, some seminudity (removable and NOT needed to enjoy the game, explained later on), fast pace (subjective), and taking a while to getting used to the controls, binding all the many keys to your liking, learning how to use the game features (getting rid of bullets with planeshift, controlling Phase Level), and so on. Once you learn how to play the game properly, it can be really fun, and the online duet revolutionates.  Gameplay: Good The gameplay is fluid, resposive and satisfying. An issue I do not share, but many people seem to do, is that there are many keys for many functions. Your regular shmup has a fire and bomb key, and sometimes a focus or slow-down and a charge attack key. GundeadliGne has fire, rapid fire, mana shot, bomb, focus or slow down, turn, and even a screenshot key! The best way to play the game seems to be in a controller or an arcade stick. Personally, I have to admit that it took me a while to use all keys properly. The two initial characters are said to be one for average players, that is Eryth, and one for beginners, Elixirel. Eryth can only shoot straight, is faster than Elixirel and seems to be able to cause much more damage (don't rapid fire too much or her guns will overheat). Elixirel is able to fire to to various places so you shouldn't bother staying in the front of a boss to do damage, but she's slower than Eryth and sometimes it costs you a life. The bosses bring innovative bullet patterns, most of the time, but either they are good or not is subjective. I say they are. If you're too slow to destroy enemy waves, you'll run out of time and may not be able to finish a mini boss or a boss itself. So the game requires you to go fast, but there's an issue few people might experience. Depending on your computer's hardware, the game may run slower in fullscreen mode and a tad faster in windowed mode. That happened to me, and for some motive I can't get my game to run on fullscreen mode anymore, so I was quite shocked at the difference. If you're scoring high in the game or pulling out death bombs, you'll raise your Phase Level, making the game harder. If you're not ready for high Phase Levels, try using bombs before being hit or even don't bomb at all. Giving up a few lives to not lose them all is the key. It's not explained in the game, but there's a manual you can check by right clicking GundeadliGne in your game library, and it's recommended you do so, as many other features are also explained there.  Game Visuals and Music: Moderate The pixelated graphics are nicely worked. A problem is the seminudity of some of the bosses, that can be hidden editing the .ini file in the game folder. The seminudity turns the game down for some people, making they think that this game is trying to sell with sexual content, but that's NOT the case. In my point of view, It's supposed to add to the chaotic climate of the game, just like in Bayonetta. The characters and other bosses are well designed. The music quality is subjective. The original music is not the greatest out there, neither the arranged version, but they fit so nicely, it seems they are better than they actually are. I was surprised when listening to the game OST on YouTube, as they didn't feel so awesome as in the game.  Game Storyline: Moderate Not really the focus of the game (so it's discounted from the overall rating). The story is presented between stages of the game, a screen of text alongside with character art. It's not the most enticing way to tell a story, but the story itself isn't shallow, neither badly written and translated. It's a continuation of the previous game, Gundemonium Collection. If you want to read it, you can check GundeadliGne's TVTropes page.  Game Entertainment: Good As some people would have trouble adapting to the game's many features, and some people would think bad of this game because of the seminudity, I can't say those people would feel entertained playing GundeadliGne. But if you fit the target demographic of the game, several hours of fun are guaranteed. And even better, if you happen to have a friend that owns the game and lives in the same country as you, both of you can experience the online duet at it's best, that is fantastic. However, if you're playing with someone from other country, you'll have connection issues and the controls are going to be far from responsive.  Overall: Excellent game for people that are okay with all the items listed in the introduction of this review, and have someone to play the online duet mode properly.  Good game for the standard shmup player, but they might have a bad time adapting to the controls and game features, also if they don't mind the anime style and seminudity.  Moderate game for beginners, people that would give up on trying to understand the controls and game features, and only playing the game to pass some little time, also being or not being slightly triggered by the seminudity.  Bad game for people that dislike the anime style overall, that would like to pilot a ship rather, also that thinks that the controls and game features are unnecessarily complicated and that also thinks that the seminudity is there to 'help selling a bad game'.",1,1

105600,Terraria,"This fun sandbox adventure game has a lot to offer. You could mine for gold and gems trying to get rich, or maybe go on a killing spree and defeat all the monsters in your way. You can even find islands in the sky! And the best part, you can play with you friends.  This addictive game is a 2-D sand box, boring right, not even close! There are many possibilities in customization for your character and your world. I saw this game before it was finished and thought it was cool, now it’s a masterpiece. It is not often you find such a gem in the gaming world. I already hear the people saying “A 2-D sand box, it’s a Minecraft rip off.” They could not be more wrong but because of people saying that the game doesn’t get much attention. Now let me talk about problems, with the AI in friendly NPCs they walk into enemies and get killed but that is not a problem if you have walls or doors. And the only other problems are small bugs, not bad ones, all I encountered were funny or helpful like a fish out of water when it was not raining and throwing a bomb in your own house then closing the game before it blew up and come back. POOF, the bombs gone. On a unrelated note, I didn’t talk about game play because I could not begin to explain, there is so much stuff to do or see or even make!  This is an amazing game and 9.7 out of 10. ",1,0

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,I know that this is a little late. But I have to say this for all Fallout fans. This i think personally is the best Fallout game by far. For one the story is awesome. DLC's are awesome their is alot to do in Fallout New Vegas. With mods its sprinkles on the ice cream this is the one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life and im not just saying this. I have played every Fallout their is from the first to the last. Fallout 4 is okay i do like to play that but it just doesn't give the same feel that this game delivers. This game is a lot more serious than Fallout 4. I would rate this game from how many hours i have on this from the time that it came out when i was playing the ♥♥♥♥ out of it on Xbox 360 to the time I got it on Steam. This I would give a solid 10 out of 10. Thank you Bethesda for this awesome game.,1,0

While I do sometimes feel I got shot in cover it occurs a lot less than in other FPS. Its not an easy game but a fun one. Definitley something to buy in a sale.

287290,Resident Evil Revelations 2,"CAPCOM use to be such an upstanding company with a wide diverse catalog of games that while not all award winners were, in fact, rather fun and varied. The Resident Evil series has been wildly skewed since its humble, campy beginnings but it built a lucrative franchise for CAPCOM so it's not surprising that they've been milking this particular cash cow for close to two decades. Unfortunately, their last few additions to the RE series have been ludicrous rather than lucrative, some so terrible that they've become the insult to the injury that the movie adaptations scored in the franchise.   RER2 EP 1 plays absolutely horrendously. The frequent frame rate drops, terrible mouse and keyboard controls, the frankly dated environment graphics, the terrible integration of standing graphics verses interactive graphics, the too short episode (which played like a prolog to the episode rather than an episode), and the blatant lies and hamfisted attempts to cover up those lies about features that were advertised since day 1 of the preorder cycle lead me to conclude that this game was never intended for a PC audience. CAPCOM yet again just wanted to cash in on the PC market money without actually committing effort to adapt to the needs and requirements of the market. It's clear that there was little to no testing for this badly ported title and in how quickly the company was to blame the consumers as well as some unknown copy-editor or intern for the misrepresentation of their product which didn't seem to bother them until the consumers started to complain about missing and/or misrepresented features promised to them.   The cons outweigh the pros thus far in this disastrous addition to the RE series and not even the absolute nostalgic novelty of playing Barry Burton can or ever could take the sting of betrayal, shady business practices, and simply bad ports that CAPCOM continues to employ when it comes to their offerings to the PC market.   TL;DR: This game might look good at first but it pretty much takes a dive within the first few seconds of gaining control of your character(s) and plays like an absolute brick. The story is paper thin, the 'zombies/monsters' are laughable, and the dialog, while well acted, is typical RE ♥♥♥♥♥. My suggestion is to give this game a pass until at least two more episodes and a veritable crap ton of updates and optimization fixes are released because otherwise you're paying for a terrible gaming experience. Save your money for now, my friends.  SCORE: 3/10",-1,1

The puzzles with time levers are frustrating, since you have to do everything again if you don't make it on time, same with climbings that you have to go really fast with no mistakes. If you like backtracking, you are in the right place.  The plot was vague and most of the time I've found myself wondering why am I doing this? I would like seeing more background story or feedback from Lara herself, like in TRLegend or TR 2013.   Despite of all the rage, solving puzzles and killing bosses was very satisfying.   Croft Manor was fun but moving to one place to other took a lot of time. Too many empty hallways to the garden or the gym.  The game is lenghty, even more if you are not with the game mechanics.

The combos are easy, and the game itself is challenging.  Unfortunately, playing this game on Linux with a 360 controller is basically impossible. On the menu screen, right maps to up for some reason. The dodge input doesn't work, the RT and LT buttons do nothing. While I had similar issues with Megabyte Punch, that game at least gives you the ability to change your controls. In Megabyte Punch, you select the command you want to change, then press the button you want to change it to. Simple. In this game, I don't even know how the control changing works.

On the highest settings I could still run confortably above 70 FPS with very rare (unnoticeable) drops to the 60s. Also I am playing at 1440p on a GTX 1080. I will try it on my gtx 980 another time at 1080p but i expect no changes. Great story. I will not get into spoilers.  Gameplay could be better. 1- There is no crouching function, it is done for you automaticaly when near a smaller 'cover' when under atack.  2- You can't swap the over the sholder view while shooting from one side to the other. Or a first person mode. 3- Aiming seems a tiny bit off. 4- No scope for any of the weapons. 5- Range limit for bullets? I haven't been able to hit a target unless they are within range. swaping for a sub lets me target further and rifle even more so. Do the bullets vanish or lose all damage over such short distance? Probably not. It isn't gamebraking for me, as i just forces you to use the right tool for the right job.   The skills in this game (and skill upgrades) are awesome and you might endup underusing them in exchange of a more shoot-them-all kind of aproach. They do have enemies that will force you to use them a little more.  From me it still gets a 9/10. Haven't finished it yet and I would already prebuy any sequel at this point.",1,0

Very much an updated Gauntlet for our time, as good as I *remember* Gauntlet being (i.e. better than Gauntlet actually is if I play the original now). Great non-linear level design with lots of hidden stuff. I'm not usually a huge fan of pixelated graphics, but the ones here work really well and are full of colour, detail, and neat lighting and animations. Haven't tried the co-op yet but expect it'll be great. Character classes make a significant difference in play style. I got 9 hours out of the main campaign and still have the free expansion to do.

Doubt it but hey I guess you can keep your fingers crossed with a develepment team that is making more games that they pretend to be 'series' when they have no intention of finishing them. You want proof? Go look up Wolf Among Us season two. If your lucky you might find the interview in which a Telltale games rep said that they could not confirm it.,-1,0

102500,Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™,"Probably one of the more underrated games on steam. Shame there won't be more of this series.  Graphics are nothing special, reminds me of games like Kotor and Mass Effect 1. They aren't bad, they're actually pretty pleasing to the eyes, but they wouldn't blow anyone away on release and certainly wouldn't nowadays.   Combat is probably one of the most fun experiences I've had in any rpg. It's generally pretty varied, tons of enemy variety, tons of weapons etc. When you unlock some of the better abilities (like the aoe fire spell as a mage) you actually feel like a badass killing machine. Very rewarding experience.  Haven't completely finished the game yet but main story and faction quests are all pretty entertaining. Not as good as some of the other rpgs I've played (like Kotor) but probably on a similar level to a Fallout or Elder Scrolls story. Not amazing but sufficient. Only complaint is that most of the side quests are very menial, some are decent but for the most part they all just send you in to some dungeon that is slightly different than the last one you went to. Still worth doing as they expand on the story if you're in to that kind of thing.  This is also a lot of content for the money. There's probably at least 60 hours worth of it if you do sidequests and DLC. It really is a shame this series is probably dead, if there was a sequel with a slightly better main story with more engaging main characters and improved sidequests/less repetitive dungeons it would probably be one of the best rpgs out there.  As it stands I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that enjoyed Bioware rpgs and similar games.",1,0

The game has a ton of content and the single player campaign is very meaty, the multiplayer Raid mode is fun but the strength of the game is the single player.

346940,Shadowrun: Hong Kong - Extended Edition,"Took around 25+ hours to complete first playthrough. Lots of Dialogue, sometimes too much. Setting is great. Music is ok, combat music felt very repetitive. I think I heard the same song over and over for 80% of the battles. I love the changes and additions to cyberware. Played as a Cyberwared-Melee Decker. Money was somewhat of an issue so sometimes you gotta bite your lip and hold out for the best stuff without going for the middle level equipment. Matrix gameplay is different and neat, but still just not that fun. And in certains missions you have to do the decking no matter what, with a time limit no less. I had a great time playing it, maybe not as much as Daggerfall but more than Dead Man's Switch. If they kept making these games, I'd keep buying them. Always feel like they are a good bang for your buck and you'll spend the next few days thinking about the story and looking up alternate endings. The biggest complaint of the entire series is the lack of customization for party members dealing with Karma Points so I imagine replays would get repetitive. But I know it takes alot to balance everything just right for gameplay and storytelling, so that's the price you pay when you run the shadows.",1,0

258910,Citizens of Earth,"Don't let the cartoony aesthetic deceive you. This is a quality game. In the JRPG style (menu-based combat), you play as the Vice President of Earth, your typical blowhard politician. But you don't fight as him but as three of 30 or so characters that you collect through a variety of side quests. Each of the characters has different strengths and weaknesses, like elemental resistance, healing, powerful attacks or weaker attacks that hit multiple enemies. Also, each character has a 'talent', which ranges from super handy (like transporting from one location to another, offering powerups, zooming out in the map and speeding/slowing down time) to the useless (changing the music, the weather, etc.) All of the different characters allow you to play to your own playstyle. Want to wallop your enemies? Do it! Want to play it safe with an on-hand healer? You can! There are characters who help you level faster, who restore your energy, and many who do wacky things that have big payouts later at severe detriments now.  The story is silly and full of references to typical JRPG mechanics, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, video games in general, pop culture. The baddies are equally silly, with mutant animals like a Catctus (a cat-shaped cactus) and the Decaffinator (a robot espresso machine). It never takes itself too seriously.  Don't be deceived by the cutesy style. This is a well--crafted game. I spent nearly 40 hours trying to unlock all the characters, do all the sidequests, and unlock all the achievements. IT's a super slick design, great interface. The map is huge with tons of secret areas and collectibles.  Cons (very few and minor): There are certain tasks that can only be completed with certain characters (mainly unlocking other characters). And some of the character unlocking tasks are vague in what you need to do and require either great thought or an online cheat and are not obvious at all. (Es: For the scientist character, you have to just hang around until there's a thunderstorm, which you have no control over). Also, the world is SPRAWLING and there is no actual map that you can access, even to get a vague idea of where you are or where you need to go. There is a character that allows you to zoom out, but it doesn't go nearly as far out as the entire world. Some of the areas are not entirely obvious that you can enter (their ramps to higher/lower areas are often seemingly invisible). Thus, I spent a LONG time in certain areas going in circles, trying to access an area with a non-obvious entrance. You can go down into some of the oceans, too, which took me a LONG time to figure out. However, most of the game is clearly telegraphed with graphics or dialogue as to what you should be doing or going, though not always.  Overall: Great game, especially if you like silliness and menu-based combat. Don't be fooled by its cutesy look. This is a quality game.",1,0

236150,Starpoint Gemini 2,"I've not started any of the dlc, just doing the base game. This is a nice trade/rogue/space game using a mission system very similar to how I want to make myself. The proceedural missions scale with your skill possibly too quick, but all fights remain at least a minor challenge so you dont find yourself getting too over powered, or bored for that matter. If combat starts to bother you, mining exploring and salvage make nice distractions, and it all seems to help you gain xp if the next story mission prooves too much challenge.  I've not encountered any crashes and much like self driving cars; the only bugs i find are when i let the ai do the work i should be doing from laziness ;)  Seems like a nice casual trade/space/combat game in many ways reminding me of star trek online space combat.",1,0

550,Left 4 Dead 2,"Even though this game is over 4 years old it still holds up as being one of, if not THE best zombie game on the market. It's not only fun playing single player but it's hilarious when you can get three more friends to join in the zombie killing.  There's of course the standard Easy - Hard difficulities (Here being Easy, Medium, Advanced and Expert). So if you're looking for some mindless slaughtering to do you can put it on easy or if you and your friends is a tatical squad preparing for the zombie apacolypse this is a great way to start!  Also you don't have to play the first game to get into this one, all the maps and more from the first game is in this one. Even if you want to play oldschool there is a mode for that. Speaking of modes, there's Versus mode which is exactly what it sounds like, you control both the infected and the survivors in rounds. The one who ends the final map with the most points win. There is also a realism version of this mode which means the survivers can't see the green/orange/red glow around them as they used to.  There's also Survival which is aslo what it sounds like. Survive for X amount of time and you get bronze, silver or a gold medal depending on the requirments for the map you're playing.  Scavanger is the last major gamemode, here you play as survivor and infected and the objective is to fill a generator with gas. Who wins depends on which team's the fastest.  Then, finally, there's something called mutation. These are pretty much fun little mini modes. For example you have to try and survive an entire campaign on your own, you and all your teamates have katanas and can't get other weapons, you need to carry around a lawngnome to win etc.",1,0

Beautiful graphics, smooth gameplay, and very satisfying gore and gunplay. Multilayer is ok, I dont really care for paying for the dlc's maybe if they made a single player one Id get it.

241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"The gameplay is really fun, especially the Nemesis system. The story is a bit lacking.  If you're a fan of Assassin's Creed or the Batman Arkham series, you'll most likely feel right at home with the combat and mechanics of this game.  The combat itself is a bit generic, but they added special abilities that you can execute after you have a certain number on your hit counter. It's very counter spam, but counter will not instant kill your enemy, which is a great change, since it makes enemies that much more deadly. To counter the simplicity of the combat system, there are 2 different counter-measures. The first one is... Call in more enemies. You will most always be outnumbered, but they really like to stack on the Uruks... Sometimes you'll be standing in a crowd of 30+ enemies trying to tear into you. The other method of stopping you is to call in a captain. These are special units that have their own strengths and weaknesses. They have high health and can vary in their abilities to destroy you. Because of the Nemesis system, often times not only 1 captain will show up. When I went to attack a Warlord (above a captain) he showed up with a captain as his body guard... 3 more captains showed up during the fight. On top of all the Uruk that were surrounding me. I ran away. Combat diffuculty done right.  Unfortunately, there is a very large downside to the Nemesis system... If you suck at this game. When you die, politics happen. Whatever Uruk killed you gets a promotion to captain, or a higher rank captain. There is also battles between the Uruk captains, so there are a lot of promotions there. This means... if you suck, and die a lot... Your enemies will get stronger and stronger. The longer you survive, the more politics take place during your death. So, surviving a long time is also a bit negative. I wish instead that the Nemesis system was on a timer of sorts. Politics should happen if you don't stop them, rather than wait for you to make a decision... or just die.  The story itself is fairly dull. So far, there are 3 stories going on... You want revenge against Sauron's right hand man. Your friend wants to fight Sauron and his followers, and your spirit companion has amnesia. All 3 arks are fairly generic, and you learn who your companion is pretty early on.  So, this game is great fun, but it's fun because of the gameplay. I really hope that Monolith Productions keeps this Nemesis system in their future games, and expands upon it.  Have fun killing all those Uruk.",1,0

I give this game a thumbs up because i like the general game, when reviewing a game i dont think you should give a disslike because of content you don't have to buy, but review as the game in itself. CA you deliver the goods, and the recent uppdate makes it very enjoyable. but rethink your viewpoints on the DLC's.",1,0

211400,Deadlight,"Before starting the review, the inputs mentioned below are for the Xbox-360 controller.   Although this shows up as a positive review, this game has some serious flaws. The concept is simple. It's 1986, zombie apocalypse has happened, and you control a character in the middle of this ♥♥♥♥ storm. The game plays as a side scrolling platformer with bits of combat mixed in. The game at its core is fun. Unfortunately, due to clunky controls and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game design input decisions, this game can be extremely frustrating.  At first it's not really that noticeable since the platforming isn't urgent. During later parts of the game where you need to have perfect controls or you die and have to do an annoying 30 seconds to get the place you were previously, it gets a bit tedious to put it nicely. And whoever decided to make the jump button also the 'drop from ledge' button is a ♥♥♥♥ing moron. I have played plenty of platformers where you have to either press B to let go or hit A + Down Input. So good job there Tequila Games. *insert sarcastic thumbs up*  Another flaw was breaking free from a zombie's grasp. I felt that after breaking free and pushing it away from your character would at least stun any other zombies around you for a split second. But lo and behold, you push one away and another just decides to go in dry. This is unacceptable considering I have seen a stun after breaking free from enemies in many other games (mainly Resident Evil). I have no idea why they decided not to include this other than they wanted to increase the difficulty of the game artificially.  The part which was really irritating was near the end of the game. I felt as though there was a huge difficulty spike to not make the game more challenging but to prolong the length of the game just for the sake of prolonging the game. There are plenty of moments where I go 'What the ♥♥♥♥!?' followed by a long stream of cursing. I thought up until that point, the game was a decent platformer. Although the 'rat cage' level was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ considering I didn't want to play a ♥♥♥♥ing Prince of Persia rip off for one and a half hours.  Even though I have mentioned the flaws above, the game is quite beautiful. The art direction definitely represents that this version of 1986 is bleak with no signs of awesome 80's films to cheer everyone up. You could even say that the best character in the game was the world itselft. It's tired, gritty , depressing, and has no guilt about taking the lives of the people that live in it. In all, it's a decent game and I'd definitely say it's worth a play through if you can pick it up on the cheap. I would most definitely not pay full price for it. It's not polished enough to warrant the $14.99 price tag. 8/10",1,0
204360,Castle Crashers,"Plays fine and looks nice, but all you do is press X and Y so many times so quickly that your arm will explode. Button mashing on this level is about as painful and barbaric as it gets. I have never been so confused by the Steam scoring system. This game is not 'overwhelmingly positive' not by a long shot. Here is the game from start to finish: relentlessly hammer X sometimes Y to attack probably ten to fifteen times per enemy and you get flooded with them. If you want carpal tunnel, play this game.

242840,In Verbis Virtus,"So where to begin with this game, I love the Story and Mystery behind everything you do in this game. The Audio is amazing and engaging. The Art Design is beautiful and stunning. The Stage progression was good and it was easy to understand where you were supposed to go as long as you explore a bit to begin with. Now the Voice recognition is cool and all but there were a few times were I would cough and it would count it as the Command spell or I would say one spell and it would interpret as another and I even set up my own Voice profile in the settings though it was mostly on the dot with what I said most of the time. Oh but I do love the sounds of the language used for the spells it was mystic yet regal.  So to wrap it up I love everything about this game even with the few times I got annoyed at the Voice stuff. I would give this game a 9/10. Mostly because there are a few areas where you can bug the game out a bit and the voice recognition still needs some improvement in techonogly before it can be prefected for a game like this. Still though Great work for a very small team.",1,0

223430,Miner Wars 2081,"To start: I loved playing this game. To a point. The controls seemed awkward at first, but once I got the hang of them, it turned into sheer awesome. That is, for a while. I've played through every single level of this game. Twice, actually. First complaint: I have never received a single achievement. There are 12 achievements. They are all based on story progression. I have none of them. I beat the game twice. There is an issue there.  Next, the... sheer incompleteness of it. There are a huge number of extra missions and things, and... Well, you see, by the end of the game you have three allies. Before a certain point, you only have one. Then, I think, you go up to three. Then back down to two, then up to three again. No matter what time during the game you venture to the optional side-missions, you WILL have all three allies. Even if you have no idea who the hell they are, or if you currently believe that ally to have DIED HEROICALLY. He's just hanging around with you in a sidemission. But that's not even the worst of it. Some of the sidemissions are just plain crap. You have, basically, a bunch of random crap that's really not useful at all and maybe a few mineable things just... there. Around you. Blow 'em up if you like. Maybe a few enemies will wordlessly appear. There's no mission. It's just... There. Pardon for the lack of specifics, but it's been a while since I last played, but... One of the 'sidemissions' is New Moscow, or something like that. The Russian's big main city... Er... Sorry, did I say city? I meant a few defense turrets mounted on buildings that you can blow up if you shoot a hell of a lot. There's not even a shop. Which reminds me, if you expect all the shops to be actually functional, you'll be sorely disappointed. There's quite a few that are just completely and totally nonfunctional. Heck, the 'shop here' button shows up. Mash it 'til your keyboard breaks. Have fun. No point to it. And then there's the mining. I could have enjoyed that so much. I love mining in games. I LOVE open world sandboxes. But you know what? I hated it here. I'd prefer to just waste a missile on a uranium deposit instead of take the time to actually mine it. And I tried. Oh, I tried SO hard. But the default mining equipment is the ONLY mining equipment. There's no way to enhance it. So the 3 or 4 seconds it takes to mine ANYTHING will ALWAYS be that way. And it's just plain not worth it. Not in the slightest. MAYBE if you're mining one of the really, really valuable resources, but still. You can find more money by just looking around and looting things. And don't bother with the secret rooms. They have nice loot, but not nice enough. And beyond that, sometimes the game just stacks crap against you to a stupid extent. One level, the offensive turrets are literally indestructible. Literally. You actually HAVE TO disable them through the control console for them, or you won't even be able to progress in the mission. I blew up the generator that powers the console for those turrets... And wound up trapped in the level, basically. I couldn't do anything at all because I had disabled the console which I literally could not progress without accessing. And the game just... kept going. Didn't really care. And one of the secret rooms I mentioned before? I found it. I could see inside it. I then spent ALL MY AMMO and EVERYTHING I could think of on trying to get into the damned thing. There was nothing. At all. Not in the slightest. This game is a brilliant, beautiful START. ... But it's only a START. It needs to be refined. It needs to be FINISHED. It needs to be added to. And the worst part? The very end of it is just an enormous cliffhanger. And I haven't heard of Miner Wars 2082. They got their money and they're done. You see this on sale? Maybe you get it. Just don't expect things to be perfect. It won't be perfect. It'll disappoint you in a dozen different ways. But if you can get used to the controls, like I did, you might just find you enjoy it enough to bother paying... say... five bucks.  I don't recommend it at-price. If you get a sale, MAYBE. But don't expect it to be complete. You've gotta take it into your own hands a little. And don't be afraid to change the keybindings. I definitely had to.",-1,1

218620,PAYDAY 2,"I wanted to write an honest review about the game amist all the chaos in regards to latest Black Market Update. Ever since the early beta of the first game Payday: The Heist, my friends and I have adored the gameplay and mechanics behind the game that came to be one of my most favorite games imaginable.  Payday 2 (not Overkill) is wonderful, unique experience that I have spent almost 400 hours in with and without friends robbing banks, breaking into art galleries, fighting with the mafia and many other fun times squished in to one big game. This game for me has been one of the funnest I've ever had with a game and the community behind is also lovely even to this day. There are tons of mods (all of which by October 15th 2015, have been claimed to have been broken by the devs) to pick and choose from to customize your experience and make the game even greater then it already is. Just speaking off the top of my head the game has about 40-50 some odd guns to pick and choose from and about 10-20 more dlc weapons to make for a more fun experience. Some can consider these dlc content packs pricey but as shown on the steam store the dlc regularly goes on sale for up to 75% off making the content extremely cheap and affordable for everyone.  The game has about (to the time of this review) 50-70 heists to pick and choose from with unlimited replay ability because the heists will always randomly generate the enemies, objective locations and enemies (minus a few exceptions). There is an exact number for that I just cannot at the time remember what it is.  The DLC is plentiful and a lot of the time well worth its money and the best of all optional to purchase so it doesn't always feel like your locked behind a pay wall barrier. The amount however at first glance can scare a person off so it can be hard for a person to get into the game, rest assured none of which is required to actually enjoy the game as the game has hours upon hours of free content for your enjoyment.  Forgive me as I don't have much experience professionalized reviews and I know I'll probably have this review flagged/report spammed and mutliple thumbs down for my lack of '♥♥♥♥ OVERKill' in any of what I've typed.  I myself am confused and slightly weirded out by the latest update all things considered as Almir did say on release god knows how long ago that was, saying 'no microtransactions'. But really and truthfully, people need to understand that people change, their views on things change and forget about what they said in the past, heck I do it all the time. I promsied my friend I would play some vidya with him but then like an hour later without even consulting him I just decided to sleep instead.  I'm not going to mark this game down because I don't believe that OVERKills choice of adding an optional mechanic that gives extremely minor stats that which don't really make a big difference should disregard all the fun times OVERKill has given me while playing this game and its previous ones. I cannot say how many hacked lobbies I've joined where I've laighed my ♥♥♥ off cause we were in stealth and the gun spawned 100 snipers in the vault and the whole crew was down simotainiously so we lost the mission. Off topic but I don't think we've even given Almir or OVERKill a chance to come out and say why they made the choice in the first place.   I like to consider myself optimistic but I'm willing to stick in there for a bit longer to see if OVERKill can make up for this big mess they brought on themselves.   TL;DR The majority of negative reviews here are bandwagon hate on Almir because I think it was like 2-4 years ago or something he said no microtransactions? I could care less tbh I'll ignore the vaults like I ignore the creates in CS:GO or TF2 and find fun in the game. This game with or without friends is def worth the money and I hope whoever picks it up finds as much fun as I've had playing it.  PS Leave Almir alone he is the community manager not the one who makes these choices.",1,1

Mind you, I love playing games that are 'old school' or 'variation on a theme', like RPGs, new episodes of well-known franchises etc. But sometimes, you find a game that is based on a great idea and it just is such a pleasant surprise.  I stumbled upon this based on TotalBiscuit and Jesse Cox playing this together, having SO much fun in their video. I wanted to get this for quite some time, and when this was on sale, my gf gave it to me as a present. We soon started playing, and omg, it is SO much fun.  You prolly know what the game is about...one person defuses the bomb, the other is the bomb specialist and gives instructions with a manual. As the defuser, you have to describe what you see, so the specialist can figure out what module you are dealing with, and can guide you through defusing it.  PLEASE stick to the rules... don't let the specialist look at the screen, don't cheat. This game can be SO much fun if you adhere to the rules. The timer is merciless, some modules are a breeze while others will have you panic as time is running out while you try to figure out a more complicated riddle.  The basic idea is awesome, and this game is so much fun to play together... defusing a bomb with only seconds to spare is such a rush and feels like a true achievement, and you'll prolly go forth and back between frantically yelling at each other, asking for a better description or the right answer, or just laugh because this is just a ton of fun.   This truly deserves an award for the idea, and for the execution. If you have someone to play this with, don't hesitate, just get it and try it, whether it's on sale or not!",1,1

347690,Natural Soccer,"There is no online multiplayer in Natural Soccer.  Your options are local multi-player - which is extremely fun - or single-player.  The single-player option is fun and challenging at first, but gets boring after a while because the league mode is very long, has no promotion or relegation, no cups, no team management, no team roster, no top-scorer stats, nothing that really bonds you to the team or players.   However, I still recommend Natural Soccer to those who want a fun, arcade soccer game to play locally with friends or family.",1,0

You really do frag it like it's 1999, and Toxikk does exactly that! So, here's the deal:   This is a perfect example of an Arena FPS. (middle finger at Doom 2016's sad excuse of a multiplayer) there's no loadouts. no perks. no player attributes. no regenerating health. no, a player doesn't die because the other person saw them first like in a military fps. There's no such thing as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You spawn in, find a random weapon somewhere and fast, and go ♥♥♥♥ someone up....like it's 1999. you died? well, suck it up. just get your ♥♥♥ back in and try again. Try some tricky movment techniques,----yea this is like unreal tournament but I think this is way better than UT4 alpha as of right now.   LISTEN UP: Free version gives you access to a tutorial mode, all weapons and other pickups to ensure zero ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on competitive games, and SOME maps, so this review will not get a full vesion until I have further played the full game and see what are the pros and cons there.

6850,Hitman 2: Silent Assassin,"Hitman 2 is one of the the best stealth games that has ever released. I'll add that the foliage physics are now absent from this iteration that were previously found in Hitman: Codename 47. I also like how ballistics work in the game, it's unique. The level design, for it's time, is phenomenal. Such is the case with the storyline. It kept me immersed throughout my playthrough. The environments are enormous this time. And they're filled with NPCs, that may be civilians or enemies, so you won't get bored just wandering around.   The animations, however, are a bit clunky. But, again, taking into account its release date, it seems fair. Besides, it's nothing that would keep you from stop playing. I really, really loved sniping in the game. Some may say that the game is 'hard'. But that's just casuals whining how they can't move the mouse properly. The game's difficulty is realistic when played at expert, the AI becomes even more clever. At professional difficulty the game becomes frustratingly hard, you'd have to be a pro to achieve a silent assassin rating in that! I played it on PS2 and i have to say that ''Hitman'' series was my childhood and ''Silent Assassin'' one of the greatest parts .",1,0

278460,Skyborn," Skyborn  is an RPG in the style of classic SNES-era JRPG's. It's fairly typical to the genre, but I found that it had some nice tweaks that kept it interesting.  The turn-based combat system features 'threat' for each party member, which rises as that character does more damage against enemies. Enemies will always attack the party member with the highest threat, leading to some interesting decisions. The characters' special abilities were varied and each party member felt unique. Buffs, debuffs, and other status changes were key to winning battles, so I didn't feel like I was just constantly tapping the button to attack. Several times during the game the characters will be able to upgrade their class, with each of the options granting different new abilities.  There are no random battles, but instead monsters wander around the map. Once they are defeated, they're gone forever, so you can't really over-grind. Leveling up doesn't increase your stats all that much anyway, and most of your stat boosts will come from new equipment. Equipment can be forged from various stones found in the environment and further augmented with gems and other items.  The story involves the conflicts of ground-dwelling humans and winged skyborn who are gifted with magical abilities. It kept me playing and had a few unexpected twists, but wasn't anything truly ground-breaking.  I first started the game on Normal difficulty, but after finding a few battles too easy I switched over to Hard. I found battles much more interesting on this setting and I kept it this way until the very end of the game. The second-to-last boss kept destroying my entire party before they could take any actions. As I was at the point of no return with no way to get better equipment, I could either load up an earlier save, or decrease the difficulty level. I chose the latter. Reading the game's author's comments on Steam, it looks like defeating the final bosses on Hard would have required a lot more effort, so my regret over this decision is minimal.  If you're looking for a relatively-short classic JRPG with a few modern twists, I'd definitely recommend giving  Skyborn  a shot. It's been bundled several times and I expect it to do so again, so you should be able to find it for cheap.",1,0

Boss fights involve 'run around in circles and shoot the bullet sponge with my massive stockpile of ammo: In the first Metro I felt fear to confront even the Nosalises. Last Light fails to make you feel like the hunted, the 'victim of natural selection', because only just a minute ago you killed something the size of France and collected a lifetime supply of ammo from a bunch of idiots who forgot their gasmaks.  Regardless, Last Light is a good game if you enjoy FPS's. However, if you are looking for a game to follow the immersive gameplay of Metro 2033, don't bother.",-1,0

But what sticks with me after playing, and what makes me write this recommendation, is the story. The story is the main character here. Every single object, from a cassette tape to a note slipped behind a drawer, tells a story, and with it the larger tale. And that tale is of a family, their surroundings, the people they meet and everything in between. None of them are physically present. None of them are talking to you. But you feel them all the same, as you trace their presence through this empty house, filled by a breath of life so unlike anything that I have ever seen before.  There were times when I felt on the verge of losing myself in Gone Home, despite it's relatively short runtime. The immersion is something out of this world, stirring emotions I'd very rarely felt before in a game. This game needs to become recognised as a work of art, because if this isn't proof that games can be art then I don't know what is. I hope, and I hope that you will hope too, that this will be the dawn of a new type of games, one where story takes the stage, and you find it bit by bit in a lovingly crafted virtual world, invigorated by the breaths of artists, as well as the people that they are underneath.",1,0

517710,Redout: Enhanced Edition,"The best thing I can say about this game is that it made me want to play Wipeout. I feel like I'm a good way through the game and understand how it ramps up. It's a pretty good antigrav/arcade racer (if a bit clunky) but it serves as a reminder that there will never be another Wipeout.  Good: - Visually gorgeous, simplistic style with great effects - Decent music - Good controls/sense of speed - Interesting track designs - Motion looks amazing at 144hz* - With enough speed you can take a jump and fly up to the edge of the skybox - Boss mode is something I've never seen before and is legitimately interesting. Like many racing games, Redout re-uses locations for different tracks but in boss mode, you switch between tracks in the same area multiple times DURING the race, leading to very long laps and also meaning you need to be familiar with them beforehand as the track switching throws you into different parts of each track in a strange order.  Poor: - Redout/Greyout mechanic does nothing for actual gameplay When hitting sharp declines or inclines, you're meant to pitch down or up respectively so you don't see a colour tint effect for half a second. The only time this matters is on extreme inclines so you don't scrape your ship against the ground. - No rebindable keys, not even an alternate layout I would have liked to make the arrow keys turn and A and D strafe, seeing as that's how most games in existence use WASD. - Music tracks are assigned to specific race tracks, which repeat constantly. (1 song per track) Some of the songs also have distracting beeping noises that sound like a low health alarm or something. - Some of the worst A.I. I've seen in a racing game. On tracks full of tight corners they get left in the dust and frequently hit walls but if you pass them in a gentle/straight area (even with a fully upgraded vehicle) regardless of your speed they immediately rocket in front and 'magnetise' to a distance about 5 car lengths ahead, and will continue doing that until another series of tight corners. - Uneven difficulty curve. The first 10 or so events I didn't see another driver outside of the start of the race, then suddenly the aforementioned rubber banding kicked in. Track designs also do not flow well, especially in Alaska. - *Graphical settings do not save. Every time I launch the game I need to raise the max fps, turn off motion blur and turn off v-sync. - COULDN'T TOP SKYNYRD Everything in Redout that tries to emulate the feel of Wipeout, from the announcer to some of the menus to the ship designs, just makes me want to play Wipeout instead. Which I did, and after playing more Wipeout Pure on PPSSPP it's GAME OF THE CENTURY",1,0

It also has a great feel for battle, even though it's an old game the graphics are outstanding.   It's well worth the $8.00 I payed and I would recomend this to anyone that likes war and fighting games.   There is an endless amount of custamisation that you can do with your charactor / army, this includes / wepans , armor , horses. Then we have / 100s of different units , upgradeable units , followers , forts , armys , kings.   I mean who doesn't want to own thier own army and have a fort controlled by them!   It alos has a great siege gameplay, where if your forts / castle is being attacked you go onto the battlefirled with your army! And when attacking you can meet the enemy at there gates for war!   You can play 3rd and 1st person giving it a realistic feel to the game. I love the way you can go seemlessly through battles and control the world!   Now lets get onto some of the negative points:   Although it's a great game it's multiplayer lets it down massivly, with alot of lagey servers with not many players makes for an unenjoyable experiance, with hackers and glitching a big thing you don't get a good feel for the online.   You can also lose what you have built for 100s of hours in one battle, I guess it gives it a realistic feel, but it's very annoying.

21100,F.E.A.R. 3,"This doesn't even deserve the title 'FEAR'.  It's a series of shooting galleries loosely themed to the game. You enter an area, kill a few dozen enemies, then they unlock the door to the next area. This pattern repeats to the end of the game. There are no interesting places, no interesting gameplay - its literally just one big shooting gallery with COD-esque gameplay and a points and ranking system. The plot can basically be summed up as 'Fettel is resurrected and competes with Point Man for Alma's attention', which in my personal opinion completely ruins both characters. Even Beckett, from the god-awful FEAR 2, was ruined by framing him as some sort of weakling who'd be an alcoholic if he weren't in such dire circumstances.  Every single positive point to the series was removed in favor of this ridiculous shooting gallery gameplay.

You can generate new worlds and port your character between them. You have a perma-death mode for your character, if that’s what you’re into. From what I experienced, the game is pretty relaxed, and I enjoyed playing it while listening to podcasts or watching, actually mostly listening, to something else on a second monitor.   Pros: you can make lots and lots of items in a world that has a pretty artwork.  Cons: you don’t know what you can build unless you already have all the materials for it.

207230,Archeblade,"Back in 2012, I really loved this game.   It was great, a simple PVP game with interesting characters and all the cash shop items could easily be purchased with in-game currency based on your performance during matches. It was everything I liked in a game. Why give it a thumbs down, then, you ask?  Well, first of all, the developers have decided to completely abandon this game because of poor marketing strategies, so no new things will ever be added. The biggest reason of all, though, are the people.  In the past few weeks I came back to this game, expecting it to be that fun and highly competitive game I loved so much. But to my repulsion it's basically become a 'if you hax u win' type deal. It's  filled  with nothing but people who like to spam hacks to win, and gloat about it after. These people don't even have the actual skill to play, only how to pull up base files and edit.   Most of the community has turned to absolute garbage and I refuse to ever play this again until something is done, which, seeing as the main developer hasn't even been online in a year, does not seem likely.",-1,1

The game is priced correctly for such a short game (~8 hours), at 10 dollars off a normal priced one. It's not something you'll be playing for weeks and I am actually refreshed by that. It's totally story driven and doesn't pretend to be something it's not. The creepy atmosphere always had me wondering what was around the corner (or what was through the next wall!). I tried my best to guess who the killer was and by all accounts I failed at that. If you want to take a break from that FPS and sit down with a good story-driven game, pick this one up!

233550,Another World,"Just finished playing the [slightly] remastered version of Another World. I say slightly because even though they smoothed out the blocky graphics and animations, it still holds a dear place in my heart as they kept the original art style for the time that the technology would allow. Playing this game brought back a lot of memories as I remember playing this on my brother's Sega Genesis 20 years ago! And, most annoying of all, I never beat the game back then! Time restrictions due to tv-limits and homework, coupled with the fact that there was no save option, made the game nearly impossible for a kid like me to beat. So, proudly, I am now able to say I beat the game!  Sure, it doesn't have the snazzy graphics, enthralling plot (there's no real talking throughout the whole game), or variation on gameplay that many of today's games offer, but it was a great game for its time and I can remember that thanks to this anniversary edition. What the game does very well, is pull the player into 'another world' through an immediate introduction of a science experiment gone wrong that transports the player. The characer has no personality, but the goal of trying to guide this lost soul through a strange world is enthralling enough to pull a player in, and forgive the game's lack of contemporary graphics. Infinite respawns upon death, back to the last checkpoint, make the game fun to play and explore, although the game is short. A skilled player could probably beat the game in under two hours upon their first attempt. Quickly executed button pushing requires a certain amount of skill, and some of the puzzles are fun to figure out. A few of the puzzles will most likely require help from this new-fangled contraption called the interwebs...probably a fad :P  I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to see what a great game from 20 years ago (that can still hold its own) is like!  Ratings out of 10: 1 = low, 10 = high. Graphics: 4 (a 9 if this were remade today) Sound: 8 (sound makes up a huge amount of the game's atmosphere, especially since there's no talking) Story: 8 (I may be a bit biased, but I can see this as a great sci-fi novel) Gameplay: 9 (Experimenting your way through a foreign world was a puzzle in itself) Execution: 10 (Gotta give credit to the game for being such a well-done game for its time. Didn't really see much in the way of glitches or problems. Getting stuck on a puzzle doesn't count!) Overall: 8 (I'd love to rate this game higher, but today's gaming landscape is so far advanced compared to 20 years ago. Many indie developers could probably make a game similiar to this if they put their hearts into it.)",1,0

232790,Broken Age,"This game has had my attention the minute my eyes landed on it and then I saw it on early access, I just had to get my hands on it. It seemed to bring something quaint and unique to the table.. Turns out, that guess was right.  The sceneries being 2D hand-painted is an art in itself. Honestly, I found myself just staring at how beautiful the game was quite a few times, I mean, even the menu was quaint, as much of a redundant thing that may be to mention. Topped with a lovely and perfectly fitting soundtrack from Peter McConnel (Who also put together the soundtracks for; Brütal Legend and Grim Fandango). it's all the little things that just make the entirety of it so appealing.   The story-line giving you two different lives with different things to do on each side is already a concept I quite enjoy, it doesn't overwhelm you with too much to do or a need to switch between the two, it just melds in a whole, brilliantly.  The only thing that may throw it off for some is the movement system and no kind of hints for some puzzles can make for a bit of back and forthing looking for required pieces. That aside making a point and click so enjoyable is quite the achievement.  I'm glad they have gotten far more than their goal funding so there will be a chapter 2 soon released as I cannot wait to play the next adventure. Although I have seen a lot of complaints that it is far too short and too expensive for 3-4 hours of play time just in chapter 1, it is an early access game, you buy it to be part of the process of it growing and bettering itself through good and bad. It's always a given in early access. Now they have more than enough funding for a chapter 2 and most likely quite a few more chapters, I personally think it will end up being quite worth it even though for me it already is, just for the amount of work and detail poured into it, I mean, just the surroundings being hand-painted seems to be such a rare and beautiful thing to see.  Final summation, lovely game, awesome story-line, characters, voice-acting and all around charming game. Will be worth it to see it develop into a full game.   ****REVIEW UPDATE!****  As chapter two has finally come out, I feel this is due for an update.   Now mind you, I still love this game, I however feel that the execution for most of the puzzles in this chapter were even more obtuse and just downright annoying. Now, I'll be dropping a few tiny spoilers to anyone who hasn't played this yet, just a forewarning.  The fact that the game has gone through hoops just to make these incredibly and punishingly difficult really bothered me. I mean, one example is where you need to figure out how to rewire Shay's robot.. After at least an hour of raging, going back and forth, trying every combination I could think of, I still turned out empty handed. It was only when I went and looked up a walkthrough to see what I was doing wrong, that I felt like putting my head through a wall even more. The answer to the rewire was in a picture that was found in Vella's side. This is using information you never would have known been on the other characters side and something I think barely anyone would ever pick up.  Being able to switch to find out information is an okay way to do things, but the characters would have no way to actually find this out from an in-game perspective.   That aside, the entire chapter was put together really nicely with a range of different mini events happening within the game as you unlock and solve puzzles.  All in all, it's still a more than worthwhile play. Offering a total of about 10 hours of play, give or take however much you rage. Word of advice, have a game guide handy for when you get stuck and close to rage quitting, you may already have all the pieces of what you need to continue.",1,1

Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1,1

399120,Prospekt,So i played through the game in two hours. I am an Opposing Force fan and i really loved the idea that there would be more story for Shephard in this game. Sadly there isn't . Most of the time it felt like there was no story at all. You are just running through rooms full of combine and pressing buttons and going to another room full of combines and then teleporting to a next area and repeating all that again.   The flashback events about Shephards past were interesting yet annoying as they screw up the screen with the photonegative filter. Also the bright flashesh at the end were really frustrating as those got me killed multiple times simply because i could not see where i was going or where the enemy is.  I don't recommend paying the full price for this game since there really isn't anything special in this one. To put it simply if you are looking for continuation to Adrian Shephards story then keep looking because it isn't here. If you are however looking for something to waste 2 hours on and this one is on sale then you could buy it.,-1,1

252030,Valdis Story: Abyssal City,"Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a fast paced  Metroidvania  style game with enough complexity to enable each playthrough to be different but not so much as to make it confusing.   The combat system has light and heavy attacks, guard and parries, offensive and defensive spells, assists(the ability to summon members of your crew to do a unique attack), attack cancelling and dashing, and allows for both ground and aerial combos but eases into the separate systems slowly enough that it isn't confusing.  The game also has a combo system. The longer your combos are the more experience points enemies are worth but getting hit ends your combo so you'll have to use parries and dash cancelling to maximize your combos. Boss fight ranks are based on speed, damage, and your remaining health. Do good enough for an A or S rank and you gain permanent stat increases!  All weapons have different combos and all armors and accessories have unique abilities so instead of just picking the ones with the best stats you can choose the one that best suits your playstyle, even unarmed has equipment to buff it! There are three skill trees (offense, defense, and magic) each with 15 skills but only 20 levels to gain skill points with, though you are awarded a few points for sidequests as well.  You can only save at save points which also fully heal you and are the only healing outside of magic. Anytime you do get a game over you are given a chance to retry, this restarts you in the area you died with full health and mana so you don't have to walk all the way back from the save point everytime you die to a boss.  The games puzzles are all activating doors, by ground stomping or magically charging a switch, and then dashing to get through it before it reseals. Most hard ones are optional so if you aren't good at platforming you can still get through the game and there are some abilities that help make them easier such as double jump and wall jump.   Every area has things you can't get the first time through but the backtracking isn't bothersome because quite a few areas have new bosses when you return and enemies scale with you as to not make it boring.  Overall, Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a great game and I recommend it to anyone looking for an action platformer.",1,0

234710,Poker Night 2,"After really enjoying Poker Night at the Inventory (Poker Night 1) I thought well do I really need another poker game. Surely that one would do right. Well eventually at a slightly reduced price I jumped at Poker Night 2 and I regret never getting it sooner and at full price.   This game is far better.   The humour is better.   The poker engine itself seems better.   Poker Night 2 introduces Omaha poker which I have only really played a couple of times as I find it easier to work with a two card hand than a five but if you have a favourite type of poker you can stick with that and maybe occassionally switch to the other just to mix it up a bit.  Even though theres only still a fairly limited but certainly less limited amount of lines the other characters say it is varied enough to keep those same lines interesting, and the characters refer more to you the player which brings you into the immersion more. You can buy players drinks to uncover their bluffs or make them have poor judgements. Although subjective I do prefer the characters playing here than on the first game. Brock Samson was not to familiar with before playing but it did not stop me enjoying his character enough for me to look into the Venture Brothers.  It certainly is not going to be a game that you are going to play until hell freezes over but if you want the thrills of poker without the cash loss with a mix of the feeling you are playing a video game not random chance simulator 1995. I would certainly say $5 is well spent here.",1,0

367580,Hook,"This game is quite the little masterpiece of a simple puzzle game. Especially considering that it is only $0.99, which is a rediculously low price. This game starts off extremely easy, a bit too easy, but it gradually becomes more difficult after every level. Hook really starts to become difficult once you reach 36, however, almost every level before level 36 are very easy, these levels take no more than 10 - 60 seconds which is way too quick considering these levels take up more than half the game. After then the game really does feel like a relaxing yet challenging puzzle game. The sounds are soothing and soft and the music is so tranquil and beautiful, it really does fit the game perfectly. However, I wish there was a bit more variety to the sounds, as well as more sound tracks just to give the game a bit more variety in terms of audio.  Sounds / Music Score: 7.5/10  Gameplay Score: 7/10  Overall Rating: 7.25/10 (72.5% / Good)  I highly recommend this game, it is perfect if you are looking for a relaxing and simple puzzle game that is easy to learn and cheap!

It is definately worth the dollar and you should definetely purchase it if you enjoy puzzle games.",1,0

379720,DOOM," Notice : this mini review is only about the single player campaign of the game for now.  It took me a couple of hours of gameplay before I started to fall in love with DOOM (all over again!). Apparently, games and gaming develop new ideas relatively slowly, because although I thought I remembered exactly what it felt like to play the first generation shooters, I was initially stunned when faced with a cutting edge, modernized version of the simplistic format in the DOOM reboot.  Like so many have already observed, it's basically fast-paced closed area arena combat - one after another. Repeat. Prepare for the next battle. But as your skills improve, it grows on you. You start to see little things. Like how much the devs must have enjoyed putting this or that over-the-top display of gore and violence into the design. In the end, It's all about the attitude of the protagonist. Anger could hardly be simpler as a theme and motivation, but it just works. Cranking up the volume, tasting blood in my mouth, I charge into the  face  of the towering monster, tear it to pieces and love it all! ",1,0

382890,,One of the few final fantasy games we did not get (until the ps1 version) because we were to stupid to play rpg's back then acoriding to square.    this version introduces 3 new jobs. The gladiator (which is op) the oracle and canoneer.  The way these jobs are introduced if funny to because it literally mke you feel like a dumb a** saying something like well you dont know hw these classes work!   Anyways    Battle system is your traditional turn based jrpg atb gauge in all. If you played previous titles it doesn't really need explaining but basically it comes down to the fastest character goes first.   If you are going for 100% you may want to follow the treasure chest guide because there is a lot missable. Aquring spells are even missable like blue magic for instants some areas dissapear and take the enemies along with it which sucks.   Just like final fantasy 3 there are missable biestary entries as well and some are really rare encounters.   Also expect a ton of level grinding as it requires you to get to level 99 with everyone and master all the job classes with everyone including the additions    The story is actually ok it is your typical bad guy wants to be op as heck but its told in a uniqe way and actually makes you ffeel for the characters a little Which by all means is not an easy task to do.    port quality   .... meh just like ff3 you have your black borders which could probebly be removed easily because why fill up the screen am i right?

268420,Aura Kingdom,"Aura Kingdom is spectacular. There are 10 different class, including the Guardian, Ravager, Duelist, Brawler, Grenadier, Gunslinger, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard, Bard and Ronin, with more classes to come. They all have their own unique style of gameplay, from the Ravager, who deals all out damage to all enemies around him, to the Bard, whose duty it is to keep his teammates alive. As you level up, you earn skill points, one for both Attacking and Defensive stats, of which you can allocate to either damage, speed or critical damage/health, evasion and defence. These play a big part in how you survive against mobs and other players.  The game has many different things to do, including dungeons, where you team up with other players to clear the area, PvP arenas, where you battle other players, a variety of daily quests to complete and bosses to kill, or you can simply find a group of people willing to have a nice chat.   Aura Kingdom has a unique 'pets' system, known as Eidolons, of whom you can earn by gathering different points and purchasing items to create them. Eidolons aid you in battle, and each do something different - Merrilee heals you, Sigrun takes the enemy's attention away from you, and Grimm helps deal a bit of damage. You can also use a combo move with your Eidolon, which also does a nice amount of damage.  Not only does the game allow you to have companions, many skill abilities and a wide variety of playing styles, at level 40, you also unlock a secondary class. This means, as well as having the class you chose at level 1, you get another class, and a weapon, along with all the skills that class has. This allows for every player to have a unique playing style, and caters to the taste of everyone. Not only do you get a secondary class, you also earn 'Envoy Points' every few levels, which you can use in your 'Envoy Path.' In your envoy path, you can upgrade your stats even more, earn special class bonuses which activate on the use of a skill, and even unlock combo moves with your secondary class. AWESOME!   This type of game caters to everyone. It has plenty to do, many things to try out, and has a very unique playing style. I highly recommend this game!",1,0

But after I wanted a little break from Doom I decided what the hell and I let it download while I was at class.   I came back from class, was sick, on meds, very groggy and decided to say, 'whatever, lets play some Wolfenstien. It can't be that bad.' I vaguely remember the other games for Xbox back in high school and nothing from what I remember was worth the hype.   Yet, after just playing for 5mins, I was grabbed by the graphics and the story. I was drawn in not only by the story but how I could get involved almost immediately. I got to kill Nazi's, but also I got to be challenged by it and have so much variety while playing. This game is just plain ol' fun. I cannot stop playing, and every step of the way it grabs you in for more. The levels are so diverse and the overall gameplay is not repetitive. The environments are really fun to explore and have such a cinematic quality to them.   If you are just wandering around the Steam store and wondering what to buy and come across this game, this review and this question, the $19.99USD is well worth it.",1,0

26800,Braid,"This game is a small jewel.  Short, but challenging - for the mind, not the fingers - with a wonderful storyline, but most of all it truly achieves something that many other videogames (and art works in general) fail to reach: true connectedness between its constitutive elements, gameplay and storyline. Where most games are made of a) gameplay and b) story, as two separate elements, here the nature of time and therefore the puzzles to be solved would not make sense without the narrative, and actually make the narrative 'concrete'.  Braid is a post-modern work of art, if only for the explicit tribute to Super Mario, whose elements are used in new ways and assume different (and deeper) significance; and the marvellously moving final act, when the same action shifts in meaning when represented backwards.  The story is told in short fragments, each introducing a world with different time-rules, but it is compelling from the start, and will claim a place in your heart before you even notice",1,0

You're an amoral assassin, maybe you stay without scruples. What if you want to go on a bloody rampage since the characters annoyed you? Maybe before just you confess your love, you say the hell with it, just kill them? What if you wanted to join the bad guys? How waiting outside boat house after verify the bad guys have new principle and kill everyone in the boat house as they leave? After all this character is an assassin and killer, maybe they just flip and kill the red head justicar. Fun game, but they really could have played it more for laughs and give more player control. Wouldnt an assassin pursue fake relationships with suspects, have her way with them, kiss/kill them and have a romantic relationship on the side? Maybe the justicar returns as you body count goes up? (might required a skill based system to see if you survive). Lastly, maybe I choose not confess to anyone and just killing all the suspects early since the justicar is gone.",1,0

Terraria was on sale for 5 dollars at the time and was kind of a no brainer. BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE. Despite being on a potato system, I played the absolute ♥♥♥♥ out of this game. Fast foreward to 2016, I realized that I never wrote a review for this game  I rate 10,000 out of 10. Seriously just buy it.

Despite the care for hackers, they have ruined it for the consoles but on here its somewhat tolerated. The only thing now is the zombies; the mini game that brought Treyarch its name today.

270880,American Truck Simulator,"After about 8 hours of playing this game, I can rightly attest that this is one of the better 'Freight Trucking' I've played. It has a lot of feel like it was made as an advanced version of Hard Truck: 18 Wheels of Steel (same company, go figure) and it really says a lot about the game. It can be fairly difficult to adapt to the game at first but it slowly becomes more and more of ease to handle. You have the option to manage camera angles (which is all nice and dandy) but I personally prefer the whole 'Interior Trucker' feel.  With the good things there are also some downs that really stick out and bother me; noticably the necessity of the police to antagonize you for going just a little too fast. The max you can go is 5 miles over - a little irritating because the AI can pull 65 in a 50. Speaking of AI, there are a few moments where the AI drivers will stop at a red light, stop sign, yield sign, etc. and seems like they shut down from doing anything - it's a titch annoying when you're running low on sleep. The stop lights as well seem to be a bit finnicky as well. I've noticed they like to change JUST as you're getting up to it. Either you go through the light and get fined or slam on your brakes and wait for it take it's time to change.  Other than my minor complaints, the game is pretty darn good. I think it could have done better with some things (the sharpness and distance are kind of 'iffy') but overall it's probably one of the best games involving rigs that I've have the luxory of playing.",1,0

24960,Battlefield: Bad Company™ 2,"First frostbite battlefield to also be ported to PC, that means it has huge destructibility and some great physics. Game looks really good for requirements it asks for, has variety of colors and smooth lightning.   Game's campaign is nothing original, story is pretty much what you expect from modern military shooter now-days, with predictable sequences and plot twists. It lasts about 8 hours and takes you in places around the world. But main characters are funny with some great dialog. To be honest i even enjoyed it, that said first 3 hours were really boring. If you are completely new to battlefield series and to modern military fps's I advice you to play it through, but if you are experienced than you probably can skip it.   So what about Multiplayer ? First of all, servers are working, are quite populated, and I never have had problems finding full server with low ping in my region! Only problem you might run in to is that most of the players are experienced and with maxed out stats, so in the beginning game can be really hard, but there are servers which allows only noob players.  There are enough maps, with different environments such as country sides, deserts, jungle or snowy forests. They are really thought out and with destructibility they never look they same, so it makes hard time for campers and it makes you always improvise in general. However some maps are bit harder to play in rush mode if you are attacker.  MP has addictive leveling system. Balanced perks and specializations. Classes have their own unique equipment, but there are some weapons which are available for all classes so in some situations it's quite useful. There are a lot of weapons, and some attachments to them. Also game features several WWII weapons which can be used by all classes. Only I found MG's bit less powerfull than others.  Vehicle controls and combat are really fun, but takes some time to master. There are ground, air and water vehicles.  So to sum it up.  Campaign is nothing new, but definitely not the worst-one and to be honest I found it worth playing. MP is really great, well balanced, addictive and has a great variety of weapons and vehicles . Has some minor problems which you'll probably ignore.  Servers are populated and always running.   So i gave it 8.2.  Thanks for reading!",1,0
363970,Clicker Heroes,"Clicker Heroes is essentially the gaming equivalent of pet wheatgrass or a tamagotchi minus the need to participate in its development in any thoughtful or meaningful way whatsoever. It is mindlessness and pointlessness reduced, distilled and dripped through a pippette in the form of inane, twee monsters superimposed over infinite credit tickers. It is almost impossible to imagine a more meaningless game--Indeed, as I have previously alluded to, it is not really a game at all. Although I haven't tried it, I have no doubt that one could garner the same sense of satisfaction dispensed by clicker heroes by simpling multiplying random sums on a calculator to see how many decimal places you can get to.  It really is very, very ♥♥♥♥ing stupid.  It's also together quite evil, because clearly what the developers intend by this game is to turn people into rats at pellet dispensers by exploiting human susceptibility to operant conditoning: ' B.F. Skinner (1938) coined the term operant conditioning; it means roughly changing of behavior by the use of reinforcement which is given after the desired response. Skinner identified three types of responses or operant that can follow behavior.'  The particular type of OC driven by clicker heroes is positive reinforcement wed to RNG type drops for items in game ( rubies). Basically, it's gambling. The idea is that you move from something you would consider unthinkable ( spending real currency on rubies in game) to handing over real money to progress in a game which is utterly pointless, requires absolutely no skill whatsoever and is limitless.  This is of course par for the course with clickers ( rat at pellet dispenser games) and to its credit, clciker heroes does offer means by which to gather Rubies and Hero shards without the use to real currency. Irregardless, it is nonetheless exploitative, boring, pernciously repetitive. It's basically a drag net designed to ensnare those addicted to, or susceptible to, degenerate gambling type behavior.  Score: 0/10",-1,1

I like the idea of stages inside each level, that is nice, but the down side is there are also very few levels in each chapter and given that there are only 3 chapters I expected more from this Gauntlet Game. Too much Hype not enough content. I do recommend this game because even though it is short it is a lot of fun. I understand there are more difficulty levels and more items to unlock and upgrade. But I need more Gauntlet action than these levels provided. If there is more Level content going to be added to the game (PLEASE!!!) there is a lot mroe room in the main dungeon before entering the doors to add more areas to branch off of and add more doors or even portals to new realms that have tons more doors and chapters to play.

The atmosphere is unparalled by any other game in the FPS genre.   Metro 2033 Redux is a soulless husk of the original. In my opinion the pacing, mood, narration have all been essentially ruined, and it doesn't look considerably better graphically.  Beyond my own issues with the game, the gunplay is utterly unplayable. There is no rewarding sense of walking the razor's edge in a combat situation, snapping off shots into the heads of approaching mutants, even the stealth aspects are completely gone. There is no challenge in fighting human enemies at all, while mutants will soak up entire magazines of bullets without dropping. Please do yourself a favor and play the original.",-1,0

440630,The Brookhaven Experiment,"I don't think this is a terrible game by any stretch, but by the time this came out I felt a little underwhelmed by it.  I'm not really bothered about it being the wave thing with different backgrounds, because to be honest that's all I really expected...but I do think it's lost something the demo had in terms of tension, and there just isn't enough variety overall.  In the demo I feel like I failed to complete it a couple of times because I wasn't checking behind me enough or being smart enough with my ammo, so I'd hit a point where I had none left...in the full game I feel like the enemies come so incrementally that you never get overwhelmed, and you're able to conserve ammo so effectively that it never feels tense - I got to the last stage and had over 900 rounds of ammo, so you don't even need to be accurate by the end - in fact I had to stop using the Laser Sight, because it's just so ridiculously effective and the enemies come so gradually, that it's too easy to finish stages with 95%+ accuracy and get constant headshots, so you're rarely in danger of even taking damage.  There are also a few bait and switch moments I feel like never really deliver - the huge monster at the end of the demo/menu, or like in the first stage they have the jump scare of one bursting through the hole in the wall, but then there's not even anything like that for the next 5 levels, or even much enemy variety or feeling like certain weapons are needed in certain scenarios - In the campaign mode at least, it all just feels so limited that there isn't much to keep you hooked by the end - It's not particularly scary or frentic, so for me it falls short as both a horror experience and as an action one.  Haven't tried the Survival mode yet, so maybe that's a little better - I imagine at the very least it becomes more challenging, but the Campaign seems a bit undercooked, even with the expectation it was going to be fairly basic I felt from the demo that it could be quite tense and quite scary, and it's neither really",-1,0

Nihilumbra has a fairly unique set of mechanics that make for decent puzzles, the character sprite looks incredible, and there's something very original about the story, becoming more introspective and character-focused than I ever imagined it would be. If I'm honest, I expected this to be sort of a lazy indie game clone: Bastion had narration, Limbo had bleak environments and silouhettes, Tag had paint that covers surfaces and alters their attributes, but there's still something unique and special about Nihilumbra, and that's the story. Even though the story centers around (generously speaking) only one character, and even despite the cliched appearance, I was left satisfied nonetheless.",1,0

22320,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,Morrowind I think is my first game I actually bought on steam. I never tried it before but my first TES game was oblivion. After playing Morrowind for a while (I have not beat the game) it is safe to say that this game is way better than the other TES games. It has wondeful RPG elements that the other games are missing. Thought it is not perfect either. The problem I had with this game is the combat. You pretty much are clicking as fast as possible when you are attacking someone. Then it turns out that 90% of your attacks missed. The combat does get better when you level up but it is not as good as other TES games. If you do not like the combat you could also download a mod that fixes it. If you are a TES fan then you should buy this game.,1,0

I think in the future, it would be cool to see certain effects to go in reverse, like how the rain is. Maybe with explosions, things coming out of the ground/water, scarring, blood/limbs (something to the effect, not necessarily violent).

269050,Year Walk,"This is a beautifully constructed game.  The dark, supernatural atmosphere is fully immersive, with haunting music and sound effects, a creepy unlockable journal, traditional Scandinavian monsters, and a few jump scares that add to the surreal horror. A warning, though: If you are at all squeamish about blood or death, you will have a hard time playing this.   The artwork is reminiscent of hand-cut paper collages, further enhancing the traditional folk feeling of the game.  As far as gameplay goes, it mainly involves circling through a layered snowy landscape in search of puzzles and clues. As you advance the plot, new paths open up and new interactables appear. The key is figuring out which puzzles you can solve right away, and which you will need to come back to later after you have more information. Backtracking is a key component of the game, but the map is small enough that it never feels like a slog.  The built-in hint system is useful in guiding you through the main plot if you are stuck. It contains a progressive series of hints for each chapter, with the first hint being an extremely vague nudge in the right direction, and the last hint being a blatant spoiler. Players can control which hints are revealed and which remain hidden, so you only ever get as much information as you need.  Something I didn't realize on my first playthrough: Some puzzles require keyboard interaction, some puzzles require the mouse, some require a combination of keyboard and mouse. If you are stuck, it might be because you didn't realize you could click and drag an object to move it, or click and hold an item to carry it.  Some of the achievements are tricky to get, but between the game itself and the achievement descriptions, you should eventually be able to figure them all out.   While this game will likely leave you feeling depressed due to its tragic thematic elements, it is still an amazing little gem, and I would give it an overall rating of 9/10.",1,0

70,Half-Life,"Good, old, fun Half-Life. I played it years ago but never got a chance to beat it at all. Maybe because there were many good games years ago, or maybe I was just too lazy to do it. So I did it now. After many years it still brings so many joy while playing and can surprise gamers with so many well done things. In short, even tho many would say that it aged rather not good, it can be applied maybe to graphics alone. There isn't enought words of praise I can tell about how great atmospheric it is, how fun to explore every room and corner is, how interesting story/characters and 'monsters' are made, how memorable music is, how enjoyable gameplay mechanics are, how well Half-Life world and levels are designed. Valve had great idea and Valve had amazing team to make that happen. It's no wonder that it's one of the best games ever made. It's a part of something great, big part of gaming history. After so much time it still have active community, mods are coming out, people play it online.

There are only three levels and the playtime on them is about 10 hours tops, unless you really like exploring your options. Additionally, the game is too structured to promote that kind of creative problem solving.   I give it a 6/10. You're better off with a different game.",-1,0

The game is also rather short. The soundtrack is very good, however.  There is one thing I will not accept, however. The developer of this game has been moving back the release date of his game each time it 'releases,' in order for the game to be in the Early Access section and also gain visibility from being an 'upcoming release.'  Because I can not support this business practice, I do not recommend this game.",-1,0

Combining traps is crazy fun when you get it right, and the game itself is irreverent in just the right doses to not be too winky or tiresome.

Have you ever want to be an explorer? To discover forgotten treasures and artifacts? To fight mummies and... nuns? If yes (or if nuns made you confused) do not think twice!   The Renowned Explorers is a turn-based strategy game with a role-play style and well written droll story. You need to think about your next movement, about your opponents' strengths and weaknesses, you need to consider the bonuses and sometimes you just need to be lucky.   Do not let the graphics trick you. This is a decent and complex strategy game and you will need 30+ hours to learn its mechanics for sure.

Oh sweet the super-mega ultra combo just destroyed everything I needed to complete the level, awesome. The bonus is YOU LOSE! Stupid design choices hurt what would have been a really solid game.  I would only buy this for achievement whoring purposes, but its not the fastest title for that either. 4 hours in and I only have 2 achievements. This isnt my genre of choice, so you may be faster.

This is mostly because the game is not hard, you are pretty much at the mercy of the random number gen. You get ♥♥♥♥ on for three levels, then you manage a level thats endless chains and easy level up. Just have to take it as it comes, Skill is rarely a factor.  Plenty of player upgrades to make the game worth playing. I do not regret the ~1 dollar I wasted on this. I will take it to perfect game status and then uninstall forever, satisfied.",1,0

266840,Age of Mythology: Extended Edition,"Currently extremely disappointed! Worst $30 I've spent for a game I currently still own on disc from original launch and know that I love to play. Within my first 2 games of online play, which is the only reason I re-purchased this game for the steep price of $30, I cannot even play. Literally. Can. Not. Play. The lag is terrible, horrible, pathetic. Freezing for 5 seconds at a time, every 20 seconds. Both games I played stalled out at locked screens forcing a resign. I will be honest that I don't know the source of this lag, but I can conclude and deduce that it isn't Steam and it definitely isn't on my end (isp/pc/graphics). For someone that is re-purchasing this game because I already know it's great, it's sad that this issue isn't already fixed on a game that is so old. The main audience you that is thrilled to play this would be that such as myself, returning for the glory days of this game when it was one of the best. Get yourself together. This is a disgrace to a game as good as this is. If this was fixed I would recommend AoM in a heartbeat, but for now, don't waste your time or money if you want to play with other people online. If I wanted to play solo I would pop in my AoM disc and be happy. But in this day and age of online gaming in the Steam multiplayer community, there is no excuse for this.",-1,0

215160,The Book of Unwritten Tales,"So! You are a fan of point and click adventure games, but long gone are the days of Guybrush Threepwood, Roger Wilco, and purple tentacles. So, naturally, you've left games like that to the past, and whenever anyone tries to make a new one, it's all focused on graphics, never on story, never on humor, and certainly never the old 'combine these things to make this new thing to solve this puzzle'.  Well, I can say that if that is what you are looking for, The Book of Unwritten Tales is for you. The humor is a good blend of clever, self-aware, and just plain groan-worthy. The puzzles are not too simple and not too complicated. Well...ok, maybe a BIT too simple. Most of them were actually pretty basic, though a few stood out as clever.  My only complaints about this addition to the genre were fairly minor. One of the more classic moments in these types of games was in The Secret of Monkey Island where there was a whole string of events that happens outside of your control and everything occurs off screen with you just sitting there reading the text and listening to the sound effects. A direct homage to that happens in this game, but then a couple more times things similar to it happen....once was funny and a nice tribute, but multiple times sort of makes it feel like lazy writing or a way to advance the story when there's no logical way to tie two events together.  The other issue I had with this was one of...I don't know...dialogue trees? Programming? I am unsure what it would fall under but on multiple occaisons I would find an item and go 'Oh...I wonder if person X would like this items...' and so I go to check and they respond with 'Oh, hey, thanks for getting me that thing I asked for, here is the item I promised in return.' Except that none of that dialogue happened. It skips it entirely. It's not really a PROBLEM, but it certainly breaks the scene a bit and makes you kind of annoyed that you missed what might have been some funny moments.  Those gripes are minor, however, and I recommend this game a lot, even if you've never really played point and click adventures before as there isn't quite as many gaps in logic as you find in many others.  P.S. My favorite character was the dragon.",1,0

17410,Mirror's Edge," Mirror's Edge is something different.   To me, Mirror's Edge is in many points one of the best games which I've played in the past few years. But let's get straight to it:    Gameplay:  The core of every game and with Miror's Edge, the guys at DICE have done their job very well. The gameplay is direct and works surprisingly well with mouse and keyboard. Sometimes it doesn't act like you thought it would, but it's still better than in most of the AAA-games nowadays.   Story:  Not much to say. Not the most innovative story and very average. Not too many characters and the ones who are in are well written. The topic is very interesting and the world also. If you spend time on searching about the background of the story it will definetly be worth it.   Graphics:  Even though the game is a few years old, it still looks amazing! The artstyle is very, not to say extremely, clean and the colours very bright and shiny. the animations seem smooth to me and the lighting very atmospheric.   Sound:  Amazing! The soundtrack is just gorgeous and very atmospheric. It makes you start thinking about the world and the story and to be honest, some sounds are just scary which makes it even more atmospheric.   Overall the game is definetly worth checking it out if you like atmospheric, well designed worlds with a good story and if you want to play something else than the average AAA-game with the average gameplay.   And to get back to the beginning: Mirror's Edge is something different.",1,0

269650,Dex,"Dex is like a 2D brawler mixed with a simplified Deus Ex. It nails the cyberpunk aesthetic and many of the quests have multiple solutions, though the game's fundamentals are somewhat lacking. Melee combat is more of annoyance than a challenge because enemies constantly run away from you while you try to hit them. Hacking is a trivial schmup-like minigame that never really gets interesting and stealth is pretty basic.  However, much like Deus Ex, Dex is greater than the sum of its parts. Thanks to solid writing, great atmosphere and open-ended level design that rewards exploration, the game remains compelling throughout its relatively brief playtime.",1,1

223710,Cry of Fear,"Well, this is really something else.  Before playing Cry of Fear I wasn't really into horror games - in fact, I don't think I ever played any at all with the exception of a bit of Amnesia and SCP: Containment Breach. The reason I downloaded CoF was because it was a mod for HL1, and I was having serious Half-Life withdrawal symptoms at the time (seriously, where is episode 3?). What I got was not only an encouraging introduction into the horror genre, but one of the best games I've ever played in terms of character, story and suspense.  In particular, the protagonist, a nineteen year old Swedish guy named Simon, really struck a chord with me. Before playing this game I was having some serious issues in my life, dealing with heartbreak and severe anxiety to name a few. I can't say much without spoiling the plot, but the mental trauma that he went through and the way he responded to it let me know that I wasn't alone with these problems. The immersive gameplay of CoF helped me a lot and allowed me to connect to the protagonist more than any other before.  But anyway. As far as gameplay goes, it's relatively simple - if you've HL1 or any other Valve-made FPS, you should have no problem learning the controls. Unique to CoF is the inventory system, in which you can store up to 6 items, and the ability to duel-wield specific weapons. The puzzles are also challenging without being ridiculously hard, and if you get stuck like I did on the 'park puzzle' with the statues then don't be afraid to look the answer up on Youtube.  One criticism though. In order to avoid cheating, the developers have removed most of the console commands which would help you if, say, you're halfway through the game with low health, no ammo, and stuck in a room with 6 monsters armed only with your switchblade. This happened to me and I actually had to go into the game files and modify the damage values for the switchblade in order to progress. Not cool, Team Psykskallar, not cool! What if somebody encountered a game-breaking bug and got stuck in a wall or something? They wouldn't be able to noclip out.   Still, that's pretty much the only criticism I have about this game. Everything else is spot on. If you're a hardened horror fan or relatively new to the genre like me, be sure to give it a go. It's free, after all.  ",1,0

50300,Spec Ops: The Line,"I disagree with the 'feels' crap that people keep going on about in this videogame. It's simply not true, and people are just jumping on a bandwagon to glorify the storyline. It's not the next Heavy Rain or even anything close to it. I didn't feel emotion after finishing the campaign nor did I expect to in a third person shoot 'em up.  The graphics look amazing in this videogame, essentially better than the console versions that I have played. Each enemy has a minor unique aesthetic to them to individualise them and make them seem different, yet still the same to prevent the creation of emotion towards each person that you kill. Sometimes the enemies would throw out occasional dialogue discussing tactics on how to kill you, and they can lose vision of you if you aren't seen from time to time, except when it's a scripted event and they are forced to know where you are at all times.  The main characters are extremely odd, with the three characters that you visit often, one being the protagonist, a man of honor and duty, a person hired to get the job done and the mission completed. Then you have the joker in the squad, a guy who tries to make bad puns and crap jokes every now and then. Lastly, you have the sympathetic nice guy, that always tries to help and agrees with the protagonist in right or wrong situations. Throughout the storyline however, they all seem to change roles pretty quickly. The joker suddenly becomes a serious character that wants to turn back immediately and questions your every move, calling them bad decisions the entire time. The nice guy becomes an annoying person that constantly gets in the way of your moral dilemmas in situations, forcing you to believe in what's wrong and what's wrong.  The storyline contains an antagonist that jokes around with the main character, playing rock music during fight scenes and laughing at the protagonist whenever he can. When the main character does something wrong that he thought was right, he is there to laugh at him and make YOU feel like the bad person in the situation. For example, you hitch a ride on the back of a truck filled with what the characters thought was gasoline, but turned out to be water supplies for the civillians, and the trucks get shot apart and the antagonist is there on the radiospeakers telling you what you just did wrong.  The game is in a third person perspective with a sprint and cover system, but not forcing the game into a serious fighter where you require tactical thinking every move you make. Picture Max Payne 3 but without the slow motion jump diving and gunning in midair, and with sprinting included. Some guns keep you in third person unless they have scopes on them, for example using a sniper rifle will allow you to move into first person perspective to take precise shots at enemies on buildings.  Overall, the game is probably a 7/10. It's a unique game with numerous sand barriers and amazing physics added to it. The game looks spectacular, like as if you could just stand there in a destroyed skyscraper and watch the sand dunes shift and churn with the wind. The storyline isn't anything major, but a minor attempt at something new that puts it out from the Call of Duty and Battlefield franchises.",1,0

297350,The Old City: Leviathan,"A very atmospheric walking simulator, very beautiful philosophical game with a weird story/plot and a great aesthetic.   Story is pretty weird, I liked it but not everyone will like it, mainly because of the fact you're going to have to read a lot if you want to actually follow and get invested in the plot of the game, and I highly recommend that you invest yourself in the story, so if you don't like reading I'd recommend you stay away unless you'd just like to explore a nice world.  Some people on here complain about the narrator, that he uses 'overly complicated words' to sound smart, the he is cringeworthy etc... I don't find this to be true at all. If you think the words the narrator uses is to complicated and if you think the narrator misuses the words then yea, it's not the games fault, I think it's you specifically that the words are to complicated for, I think it's YOU that don't understand them. Because he doesn't misuse any words, and words are certainly not hard to understand if you understand basic English. The narrator in the game was very nice to listen to and only helped with the already weird philosophical story, plot and setting of the game.  I will not spoil anything but the atmosphere in the game and the story take many weird, or more correctly dark and gory turns. Find out for yourself but I liked it.  The game itself, the graphics are very beautiful to look at, which is almost always the case with the Unreal Engine. The music is amazing, and the game is  exactly  what you're told it is, it's an exploration walking simulator with little to no actually content/gameplay, this game is obviously marketed to already-fans of walking simulators, so don't buy this if you don't know what you're getting into. If you don't like reading I don't recommend it either, there is a lot of reading as I said if you want to follow the plot, which I recommend that you do. But you don't have to read, if you just want to explore in a very beautiful game while listening to a nice voice actor then there's nothing wrong with that.  The game is a philosophical art piece, so if you enjoy philosophy then get in, and if you enjoy art in the form of games. I enjoyed it very much due to that, it got me thinking. I very often say that Walking Simulators aren't always bad due to the lack of content, they can be great in the way of how they can make you think about things you never thought about. I don't care if you refuse to call walking simulators games, I don't care if you'd like to call them a 'First Person Art Piece Exhibit' or whatever you want to call it, it's a nice game for what it's quite obviously marketed as.   A must buy for any walking simulator fan, for any person who loves philosophy, and for any person who loves art in the form of games, and I recommend it as a new experience to anyone who haven't played a game like this before.  A must buy in my opinion.",1,0

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"I payed 60$ expecting the full game with a whole Zombies storry line, but was only to be shown that in order to get more then one map, i have to buy collectors edision, or season pass for another 60$. the collectors edision gives you a remake of the Der rise map from COD WAW, which is probarly the most popular map in the series.  Zombies has a storry in this game, which i think is wonderfull, and i like to play and get more and more pieces of the storry together, the only problem is that i did not buy the collectors edision, considering i am not made of money. so i do not know the first part of the storry.   And later when you have done the one map that is included in the game, you will know that the rest of the storry is hidden in the other maps. but to obtain these maps, you will have to buy the four DLC's that are to come, ecg of them with a 15$ pricetag. or buy the season pass for 60$.  My oppinion on this is the folowing: THIS IS ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥!!!!!

264240,CONSORTIUM,"It's pretty good if you ask me. This has many comparisions to Undertale, I.E., more focus on story than gameplay, nonlethal combat methods, supported nonlethal combat methods, Wallbreaking story, etc. Although, while I am a big fanboy of Undertale, and have had more fun playing Undertale, that doesn't make this a bad game at all. Infact, it's actually really good. Although, one thing that undertale takes advantage to in this game, is that it has a satisfying ending, that is actually an ending, if you do it right, and multiple nonsatisfying/terrifying endings if you don't. This game, it all leads up to one confusing sequel bait, 'To be continued'. It even says so itself. I'm not joking. At the very least the new game they're making (Of which's kickstarter will be avaliable on the 18th) looks pretty interesting. But let's put it all in a list: PROS: +Good story. It confused me at the start, but kept me interested and immersed until the end. +Very interesting and realistic characters and reactions. +'Say nothing'. It's about time that a game with dialogue, I am now able to say absolutely nothing when I have absolutely nothing to say. Or when there's nothing that I want to say. + In all honesty, I think that the combat is fairly nice. Nothing special, just, nice. I had alot of fun in the VR tutorials. +The ship is laid out like a bloody ship. +The voice acting is top notch from the characters I've heard. + Chess pieces. I like chess pieces. + Your armor looks cool. + It's, VERY immersive. Seriously. +Choices. Alright, you can probably tell that I'm running out of things to say, but that doesn't mean it's a bad game. I'm just running out of things to say. Most of these pros outweigh the mixed points and cons. MIXED POINTS *Admittedly, I think the dialogue is kinda limited. You use the first four function keys, function 4 always being 'say nothing'. It's not nearly as bad as it was in Fallout 4, but it's still kind of limited. However, for the most part, I don't see there needing any more dialogue options, so yeah. *Also, the dialogue system can be quite clunky for some, as there is the fear of pressing the wrong button, not knowing if you pressed the wrong button, and actually pressing the wrong button, and if you are using a controller, I don't know how you would be able to press anything. But I haven't tried it with a controller. So I'm not sure. *The graphics, are, well, I don't have that good of a machine, so I can't really complain about it too much, but they aren't the greatest in the world. But in my eyes, unless they are eyesoaringly ugly, I don't think graphics matter all that much. *Oh. I thought this was going to be in space. *The UI is pretty wierd. I'm one who despises Cyan, and despises it's use in Science fiction games, and despises hologram UI, but that's an opinion, so I am going to leave it as a MP. Now for the negatives. CONS: -Although I have some subjective issues with the UI, the UI isn't always the most responsive, and can be very, VERY -confusing. -The AI in this game is terrible. I was fighting this one shady guy, whom I will not spoil, and he all of a sudden just stopped dead, giving me a clear advantage to headshot him until I defeated him. And then when the ship is being boarded by some bad guys, I just had to go around a corner, and then shoot them. They wouldn't follow me, I just stood behind some bars and masscared them. -The ship you are on gets small when you are used to it. Atleast in System Shock 2 it was a hugemongolous ship with many features. It can get repetetive to wonder around it so much. -Dear lord can some of the objectives be confusing. -Short -The ending. ♥♥♥♥ the ending. -Admittedly, I got this on a free weekend, but I really cannot see myself paying money for this game. Especially with it's sequel (hopefully) coming out. -I get it you wan't to be pacifist, but where did that say you could only have TWO combat sections?  To be truthful, I really like this game's story and atmosphere, and I think its an underrated title. But I can't give it a strong one, seeing as how the sequel (Who's trailer can be found here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWTWJYXZvq8&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLAu3Msds_3yYijp70y6YVy_RyhDTQKsCW&amp;ab_channel=InterdimensionalGamesInc  ) is going to eventually come out, and then leave this game in the dust, with what seems to be more advanced gameplay and being on an actual mission. Plus it's being developed on UDK 4, as opposed to Source. But if it's free, or on sale for cheap, get this game.",1,0

300320,The Few,"The Few's gameplay is simple and can be divided into two parts. First, airplanes, factories, and airfields are built and organized. Then, enemies attack the player and combat mode commences. The goal is to defend the country for certain (It's maximum 50 I think, at least as I saw of achievements) days and survive the enemy raids. The animations, user-interface, and art style are nicely polished and the music fits the theme. The voice acting and monologue for the commander are really kind of great for this game! This is biggest part of the game for me :p atmophere is important for me at every games.  The game is really easy to get into because of its simple game mechanics and built-in tutorial. But unfortunately, there's no hook.. The majority of the game involves waiting to be attacked, but this can be sped up or slowed down by changing the time-pace. Stopping and fast-forwarding through time is definitely a neat feature!! The designation of linear path movements for friendly planes is also part of the gameplay. The main character can also be customized, but it doesn't serve much use in the game. The pilots' names can be changed which is also nice touch to me.. Overall, the game has little variety still.. I don't play that much this kind of 'war' games but if we would say graphics and perspective doesn't matter for me, it's a great 1940 game... Your job is to defend Great Britain by controlling the allied airmen of the Royal Air Force.. And as I can remember the games name exactly comin from here..

Being short allows you to slip through tiny passages. Then you unlock your classes that your new charcter could possibly be. The game randomly chooses 3 possible heirs to your last toon.

224820,Super House of Dead Ninjas,"This is my favorite game that I bought during the Summer Sale. Fast paced and challenging, with perfect controls! Controls can make or break a platformer and these are just great. You move and attack so quickly, but you feel in total control of your ninja the entire time.   You need very good reflexes for this game and the ability to watch a lot of things at the same time. Enemies can react VERY quickly to your character. Good thing the game has a great built in mechanic. When you kill a lot of enemies in a row, in quick succession, you will activate your Rage ability. You become invincible during this and kill everything in 1 hit, not counting bosses.   The game also has an awesome unlock system. I don't know the exact number, but somewhere around 75 different unlockable equipment, abilities and powerups are in the game. I really like this unlock system, because the better you do in the game, the better unlocks you will get access to for your next run. Expect to die a ton when first starting out, then when you start getting access to the upgraded equipment and things, you will get a lot further and eventually complete your first run through the tower.  This game can be beaten in around 4 minutes (go watch the speedrun on Youtube, it looks amazing)! The replay value is extremely high though. Lots of different modes to play, including a boss rush and speedrun mode. The unlockables will keep you busy for a long time. Leaderboards to try and improve your best times and scores. Not to mention the game is just extremely fun to play. With a very low price (pick up the great DLC also!), theres no reason not to get this game.",1,0

345860,Super Galaxy Squadron EX Turbo,"I think I have enough time in this game to say it\'s awesome.  I\'ve loved shmups since I was little. Besides jrpgs, they were what I played when I was young, and I feel a lot of vertical shmups lately have lost the arcade feel. They\'re inventive and offer new things, but nothing\'s brought me back to nostalgiaville like SGS has.   I originally backed this game when it was in the Kickstarter phase. In their video, they discussed wanting to make a shmup that brought the old-style feel into it. That\'s what sold me, and they delivered.  The music is by my favorite local band, Random Encounter, which is an extreme added bonus.   I would recommend this game to old and new shmup lovers, especially those that fell in love with vertical shmups like Fever SOS, Viper Phase 1, and Xevious.",1,0
236090,Dust: An Elysian Tail,Dust and Elysian tale is definitely not my cup of tea. I can see what people like in it. The art style is great and the characters are varied as well as reasonably interesting.  Sadly I found the gameplay monotonous and the voice acting peircing. Having given it another chance when it released on ps4 I am quite glad to say that while I can't personally recommend it I did finally find some of what people love in this title.  Not for me but might be for you. ;),-1,0

The game is a perfect love letter to every great platformer made and it isn't shy about sneaking in notes to mario brothers megaman and many more. The music is everything you would expect in all the best kinds of ways, the movements are fluid and it is clear the designers accounted for so much.  The difficulty curve is progressive but the game can get frustratingly difficult on some of the challange areas, though finishing these is for you to be able to get the games good ending.   Controller highly reccomended though you can remap your keys easily and the prompts change without issue.",1,0

259680,Tales of Maj'Eyal,"Great game that differs itself from the other roguelikes. While it may not be a 'procedurally generated' map, and there isn't anything that has a chance of being good or bad (ex: quaff potion, turns out to be a fire potion killing you) except for some abilities that teleport you randomly within a certain tile range (which you can get control of later on anyways). Without those, why should I still play it you ask? For one, this game is incredibly hard (which is a good thing). Every mistake adds up, and you have to think about how you approach enemies depending on your character, which brings me to my favorite part. There are tons of classes and races to choose from, each being unique in their own way. Classes are more rpg oriented, each having unique multiple attacks and tactics to use during the battles.  TL;DR: Great game, you should play it. While there is the free version on their website, this one adds a few more options and an extra class, and helps support the creator, who is a great guy (he actually listens~)",1,0

275850,No Man's Sky,Alright here is the deal. The game was a little over hyped but on the other half look at what 14 people could do in 3 years.  Honestly I love this game played for 3 hours the first second it downloaded (Loaded no problems) and yes the 'Multiplayer' isn't really what they said. But look if you like a game you can lose time in for a while and not have to worry about seeing the same ♥♥♥♥ all the time then buy it (Honestly i'd rather pay $60 on this than any CallOfDuty). But really the game has a willing team that cares and wants to make the game work. So if you wait it will be better.... But spoilers will come sooner than later.  And my final point is No Man's Sky is a game that you yourself make the story (there is a small I guess you could call story) you can also play like you want. Wanna go kill everything on a planet? Go ahead just upgrade the more offensive parts. Wanna MINE IT ALL! And make all the money then upgrade your mining stuff.   The game is your game. MAKE IT WHAT YOU WANT PEOPLE.   And for the nay sayers go take a look back at B4 lauch... That was even worse than this. (Oh did I mention that this GAME IS MADE BY FOURTEEN PEOPLE!),1,0

282350,NBA 2K15,"In short, this game was over ambitious that ultimatelly led to releasing an unfinished product. Overall rating 7/10  Really GOOD features: - GRAPHICS, awesome graphics! - ANIMATIONS, well the ones that actully work look amazing. - GAME MODES, there are so many game modes that you can play for year. - SOUNDTRACK, way to go Pharell :D  Yup, thats about it with the good things... now the really BAD sides: - Saving options, sound options wont save, camera wont save, action replays... you actually have to set this things over and over on every game in mycareer (at least thats the mode i noticed it) - BALL STEAL, OMG, it feels like the player doesn't know where the ball is. The animations are so off... And even if you manage to tip the ball you will be lucky if you manage to race to it and catch it because the player gets stuck in steal animation! WOW! - BLOCKS. Again, player doesnt know where the ball is to block it!  - AFTER BUCKET ANIMATION. This must be the worst! Whenever you or teamate scores, your player just jumps around the court celebrating for an hour and you cant move to guard or do anything... - COLLISIONS, ya, the ball will go through you when opponent passes, they will go through you, your player fingers will go through the ball on block attempt and the ball will still go in and score. - ONLINE... lags, disconnections, waiting times... you read it all already... - DIFFICULTY SETTINGS. Simply Stupid. Game logic, no game logic, stupid as broken light bulb. The higher the difficulty the more shots you and your teamates miss, and the opponents make more! Ya its that simple, and that stupid. Like they have no idea how this should work and just said 'OK, LETS LOWER THE FG PERCENTAGE' wow! Great!  How about the lower dificulty opponents dont go on fast breaks, or shot contested shots, or make risky pass, or dont double team, you know, stupider AI. And make them use those things as difficulty goes higher. DONT decrease my FG%. Thats simply stupid! - CPU AI! WOW! Especially defense, WOW! No contested shots, no rotation, no nothing... - SOUND DESIGN! Worst! You cant hear any interviews because of the background noise, unbalanced sound effects... - MyCAREER, they seem to have thrown everything they have at the first season and after that its just stupid boring, nothing happens. Where are the conference interview, locker room chats... whatever....  I still recommend this game for anyone that can accept these REAL BAD glitches/bugs/things...",1,0
256290,Child of Light,"Beautiful game, solid gameplay. The story is very nice and even though it's a little predictable at times, that doesn't take much away from it. The art is just amazing. Can't really go wrong on this one",1,0
226620,Desktop Dungeons,"Rogue-Likes and Rouge-Like-Likes alike all tend to feel alike.   Generally in these genres, you hack and slash your way to death with nothing left to really prove except for the knowledge that comes with drinking a suspicious looking potion and losing all your health to a single swig. You take these tips with a grain of salt as the variability to your death changes with each play-through...Although I use the term 'play-through' lightly since you never actually get through some of the more hardcore rogue-likes without hours and hours of dedication to understanding the game's many quirks and traps.   Desktop Dungeons feels like a solid blend of Rogue-Like and Puzzle with a welcome sense of progression as you earn gold and unlock new classes and races along the way. All of that mixed with the ability to spend 10-20 minutes on a single session is also entirely welcome.   The puzzle-like aspect of the game is a great mix to the genre. Instead of spending your time focusing on surviving until your next death, you know exactly what you need to do: kill all of the enemies. The helpful levels that appear next to the enemy names allow you to expect what's coming whether its a victory or a disappointing failure. Rogue-Likes are always known for their randomized nature with their random levels and random encounters; Desktop Dungeons has these to an extent but when you're level 5 and you're about to swing your sword at a level 9, you know you're not making a sound decision. The screen also turns red when your next move is fatal, which helps quite a bit as well.   The progression in the game also allows for a sense of accomplishment. No longer do you feel that sense of loss when you lose everything you worked so hard to get. Each 'dungeon' is its own instance and if you know you're about to fail you can easily just retire and keep all your money (the items you acquire get sold for more money) which can then be spent on upgrading classes, races and even buying gear to aid you on the next quest you go on.   Along with multiple locations, there's plenty of different quests and challenges you can attack. Each class has its own set of challenges that give you bonus money and there are also general challenges that give you more gold just by doing things like spending a certain amount of gold or piety during a quest.   This game is certainly recommended if you enjoy the difficulty in Rogue-Likes but like to spend a casual amount of time slowly increasing your stats, or in this case, your kingdom.",1,0

288160,The Room,"Okay, so this is my first time doing a review of something, so hopefully I do well. Overall, I thought this was a great game, albeit short, and was a wonderful purchase for such a low price.  Visuals: 10/10 The visuals were a nice upgrade from the original iOS graphics, and many little details and touches really helped the immersion factor of the game.  Sound &amp; Music: 10/10 The music and noises in the background definitely help to set the eerie tone that the devs were going for. While not necessarily memorable, the music and sounds are a must-have in this game, otherwise the atmosphere wouldn't quite work.  Puzzles: 8/10 Many puzzles were a bit too simple, and others were a serious downgrade from the iOS version. In places where you had to use two fingers on the mobile game, you instead just do the switches one after the other with the mouse. In the future, it would be nice if these types of puzzles were altered to suit the PC platform instead of showing leftover better ideas from the mobile version. I also found many puzzles a bit simple, but that could be just me.  Story: 8/10 The conveying of story fragments through sequential letters sprinkled throughout the playthrough was very interesting and worked quite well for the game. However, I would like for the next game (which I have not been able to play, due to my Android phone being incompatible) to have more story-driven elements to it, as I found that by the time of the next letter, I had nearly forgotten the last letter. On my second playthrough, however, I noticed a lot of symbolism sprinkled throughout the game referring to the main story, so perhaps they do a better job of reminding you than I give them credit for.  Enjoyment: 9/10 I enjoyed myself immensely while playing The Room (both the Steam and Android versions) and would reccommend it to most people I know, save those who throw puzzles out the window for Call of Duty or TF2. Regardless, if you like to solve puzzles and like a good atmospheric game, perhaps a little psychologically thrilling story here and there, this is definitely for you. ",1,0

218820,Mercenary Kings,"holy ♥♥♥♥ what a bad game First off the game is semi unplayable because some of the graphics were comepletely corrupted, and apparently thats not an uncommon issue. After fixing that a friend and I tried quite hard to enjoy playing this. But we kept coming across glitches and bugs and just plain poor/confusing design choices. Apparently reviving someone sends them back to the start of the level???? Bosses will sometimes just decide to leave the battle area. If you get downed in a certain way you'll be stuck like that forever, requiring a restart.   The thing that made us just straight up stop playing was when we chased a boss accross an entire level, because every time we found it, it would run away. Sometimes it would even run away before we even got to it. We were sposed to capture it, so when we finally got it down to the point where it was flashing red (which we FOOLISHLY assumed meant it was low on health and ready to be captured) we throw the capture bombs at it andddddddd they literally bounce off and have no effect.  :)",-1,0

This game even comes with a special headset-only mode to really make you question your sanity. Mix this in with an interesting art design and you have a good start.  However, I find myself not scared. But bored. The game is filled with many rooms, about sixty percent of those pointless. I had many mockery names popping up in my head as I entered room after eventless room. Eventually hoping to find that ONE room to bring me to the next set of rooms.. These names were names such as Walking simulator. Room simulator. Didn't-I-Just-Enter-This-Room-A-Second-Ago Simulator.  The game has three endings, strung together in a few paths that you can take through your playthrough. I did not find myself eager enough to replay this, thus I've decided to watch the other two endings on youtube. I assumed that what I had gotten was the ''Good ending''. But, interestingly enough. I found the bad ending so much more interesting, and to an extent, the scariest part of this whole game.

At least the first 5 hours I've played has been. Whereas most Zelda games resemble an open world (even though the sequence of events is linear). Darksiders very much funnels you from arena to puzzle to arena and is far easier than Ocarina.  Less obvious is where the theme, plot, and characters fall far short of Zelda. You'd think that playing as one of the Horsemen of the apocalypse, War, and battling demons, being a general badass would be freaking amazing. It's really not. Because of the overly grandiose nature of your character and the plot, you really can't connect with any of it on any level, and it feels like you're just going through the motions to get the game done, and it really doesn't effect you in any IRL capacity.  Contrast that with Ocarina, wherein you are a mysterious little boy given the gift of this task of saving your loved ones from a mysterious malevolence starting with nothing at all and finally becoming a young adult with a kick butt arsenal and mad skillz. A little more dynamic, emotionally, than, 'Hey, you're War, you start out powerful and get more powerful. Have fun killin' stuff.'  Overall the game is fun, and worth playing so long as you don't expect it to be different from anything else you may have already played. A solid hack'n'slash with a great aesthetic.",-1,0

The maps are wondefully intricate without the need for open world, they are not as confined as some reviewers would lead you to believe. Others have issues with the AI ,to keep this short I will simply say I don't (if you are in a hallway or staircase yes the AI will kind of line up.. obviously). The tons of secrets really justify the maps designs. ( if your Gamma is set properly) they can even be creepy. The Glory kills are repetative but a good addition to the game mechanic.  Ultimately DOOM puts you in that DOOM world with the music, the tempo of the game, the fast pace gamplay, the need to be inquisitive, the crazed demons, DOOM is a well made game, Unlike Rage, Id did DOOM right.",1,1

289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,"I'll just keep this short and sweet.  As far as a vanilla launch, this is probably the best Civilization we've gotten in the past ten years. Now, optimisation issues aside, there's a lot of content for you to bite down into; basically, all the stuff we had to wait for in expansions back when Civ 5 came out is already here with us right out the gate.  However, there are some optimisation issues; from random crashes to loading screens that never end, its a choppy game and I feel like they had more than enough time with it to prevent such things. But while I am irritated, its still a damn fine 4X strategy game.  If you're a fan of the series, pick it up. If you're new, pick it up if you dont mind spending the cash. If Civ hasn't really done it for you, this isn't going to convert you.",1,0

Game has jump of the wall mechanic and sometimes you can't jump on some ledge, where it seems like you should be able to. Hope they fix this until release.

350660,Alganon,"Looks like people have been on a mission to slam this game recently, but I am glad I didn't heed these poor reviews as I very much appreciate this game for what it is and what it offers.   As a previous long-time player of WoW (Vanilla - Cataclysm) and Rift, I had been looking for another game in this vein that would offer a new leveling experience and a new world to explore. Yes, I like questing. Although I've done my share of raiding, endgame is generally my least favorite time -- even with expansions -- and dailies can only be done so long before it becomes another job. So over the past couple years I've tried my hand at a variety of games both paid and f2p -- Elder Scrolls Online, EQ1, EQ2, FFXIV, Neverwinter, DnD Online, LOTRO, Archeage -- in search of a wow-like game that meets my 3 main criteria:    Mouse Movement (after a decade of WoW/Rift -- too old to learn new tricks) (too bad it took $80 ESO to realize)    A crafting system that doesn't make me mental (EQ : O)    No mandatory PVP  Other preferences....    no loading screens at every doorway (wth FFXIV)    no creepy anime-ish child-elf characters    a good class/points system / defined roles &amp; abilities    an auction house    an interesting world/lore with related quests   Yes, pretty graphics are nice. But so far, Alganon is on par with most of the games listed above. And as far as the cash shop, the transactions are reasonable -- more so than I found with LOTRO and Rift (the latter went F2P 2 years after I started and I found myself needing to spend so MUCH more than the $15/mo subscription there).   So if, like me, you're looking to recapture the fun of navigating a new world without spending $60 on a new (or not so new) game (talking to you GW2), Alganon may be worth your download. So far so good for me.....",1,1

200210,Realm of the Mad God Exalt,"I'll start off by saying, this is a fun game. But there are plenty of issues with it.   First off, it's a 2D RPG/Roguelike/Bullet hell game. This is actually a really good combination, the combat is fun and very simple whilst still having a fair amount of depth to it. The everlooming threat of permanent death keeps the game adrenaline filled even when you're fighting a boss you've fought hundreds of times before. The classes are unique and fun to play, each having their own niche. You can deal incredible amounts of damage very quickly with wizards, heal your teammates with priests, or stun monsters and tank with the knight. Or you can rush dungeons with rogues. Or take event bosses with an Assassin. Or clear dungeons with an Archer. For every playstyle, there is a class.  The economy in this game is based off of stat potions. These increase your stats permanently, and are always in demand due to perma death. The least rare and thus least valuable potion is the speed potion, with the holy grail of pots being the life potion. Trading with other players is a fun process, albeit long. Unlike other economies in other games the currency in this game is always being destroyed so it retains it's value instead of constantly being inflated. This makes each boss fight that much more intense knowing that even though the risk is high, the reward is much, much higher.   However the bad in this game is Kabum. The developers of this game have constantly shown they don't understand what the player actually wants. I've stopped playing this game simply because Kabum is terrible. Things they have done include accidentally releasing a warrior kit bundle for 1 gold (premium in game currency worth roughly 1 cent). This instantly tanked the price of the kit and screwed up the economy for a bit. Another thing they did to mess up the game royally was removing the ability of gland mobs to drop pots. This made the price of stat pots rise until they reverted back to the original model. Again, screwing up the economy for a bit.    Altogether a good game ruined by a bad developer.",-1,0

278360,A Story About My Uncle,"If you enjoy repetition, dying over and over while you try to figure out where the hell you are supposed to go and pulling your hair out then this is the game for you! It's hard to tell where you are actually going to land and I died repeatedly just because I thought I was centered up over a ledge to find that I was just a little bit off. I stopped at the part where you have to figure out where to go while turning on lights, that go off soon after you turn them on, in a totally black cave thing and trying to find the ledge to stand on while simultaneously targetting the next place you are supposed to grapple to and find the next light source to turn on. Walked off of the path more times than I can count because YOU HAVE NO FEET to use to tell whether or not you are centered up on whatever it is that you are walking across. I don't mind trying something time and again if I know what I am supposed to do and I am failing at it but this game has no direction markers of any kind and I fell to my death more times than not because I ever so slightly walked off the edge of a small path no wider than a foot, respectively, based off of the size of the character's disembodied arm.   I was exilerated at first, the high jumps, the strange world, the bright colors, all very fetching and then the game actually started.. I was quickly annoyed by the grapples to the little floating rocks and the lack of any way to know if you are close enough to grapple onto them or not. Not to mention on many occassions I went to a rock that I thooough was the next one in the succession but alas, no, it was not and seeing as I was out of charges with my grappling hook and it wouldn't recharge, because I had gone the wrong way, I was stuck there, forever.. or until I committed suicide or quit and repawned.  Undoubtedly I didn't make it all that far into the game but that's because within thirty minutes of dying over and over and over it was seriously trying my patience and I wanted to scream and throw my computer out the window. If you like an unfair challenge from a game that is too short, according to all the other reviews I have been reading, and mechanics that are rather clunky and unpolished then this is the one for you.  On a side note, I made a specific category just for this game, this game is the only one in the category and I have yet to find another that annoyed and frustrated me to the extent that this game did so I don't think it will be getting any company anytime soon, the name of this category is: WHAT THE ACTUAL F*CK??????

228280,Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition,"'My review is clean as an elven ♥♥♥♥!' There's not a lot ot say about this franchise that hasn't already been said. Simply put, this series is one of the best examples of when western rpgs finally started to truly compete and surpass jrpgs. If you are under the age of 30, love rpgs, and are interested in seeing the history of video games preserved you simply MUST give this game a chance. It's not perfect, but it does so many things right for the genre it's a crime that there are people going into game design who have never played it.  Pros:  -Minsc, you'll understand when you play the game -Fun story to play through with voice talent ranging from fantastic to meh -New content, classes, party members, etc. over the original game add TONS of replayability -If people support projects like this more and more developers might be willing to go back and restore their old games to make them available for the modern audience  Cons:  -Graphical barrier to entry might be a little high for some but the art design is good enough you can overcome that (You whipper snappers and your photo realistic graphics! In my day you had to make due with only one pixel and you liked it!) -Combat is a little dated and it's not always obvious what decisions you make are really changing things (a lot of stuff goes on under the hood as it were for better or worse) -Minsc can die forever if you aren't careful",1,1

I guess people less entertained by people being cut up, blood flowing through the air while parkouring like mad.  Except for the occasionally obnoxious volatiles (they were tolerable/fun at times) and the out of nowhere bombers, I didn't have that many issues with the game. Maybe a few problems with the freerunning when trying to climb walls and it stopping for some obscure reason, but that was so rare it happened like only maybe once every 4-6 hours.  The controls and freerunning are very intuitive like it was in Mirror's Edge which is very refreshing compared ot many other freerunning games where you keep flipping off walls like you totally intended that (NO, STOP DOING THAT!) while this game actually understands your intent by requiring you to do the tiniest bit of effort to signal it instead of attempting to play the game for you.  If you want splattery parkour/freerunning zombie murder game that is fun just because you Can do lots of fun stuff in it, this should be pretty high in your list of games to play (unless you want something utterly silly, then go for Dead Rising 1-2. State of Decay if you want to go in less silly direction).

7650,X-COM: Terror from the Deep,"Despite only getting into X-com after playing EU, I instantly fell in love with UFO defense. The gameplay is challenging and rewarding, although it is very clunky. I didn't realise how much the atmposphere meant to me until I played this game. TFTDs music is nothing short of horrible. Remember the music that played before a terror mission in UFO? It was just what you needed to get hyped before the mission started. In this game the music sounds like a 1950s low budget horror film. The starting items are confusing as all hell, I mean what is the difference between a dart gun and a harpoon gun? What does a partical disturbance grenade do and how does it differentiate from a magna-blast grenade?!? In UFO defense you could easily understand an items function by looking at its name.   It's due to stuff like confusing names and a game breaking tech tree (researching projects in the wrong order can render the game unfinishable) that you will almost certainly have to rely on a guide if you don't want to restart this game constantly. This isn't even taking into account how difficult the game is which oddly enough is one of the few things that they did right. After getting a hang of the basics and researching some good gear, UFO defense got very easy. The game also feels a lot buggier. I occasionally see a 3 tile long river just floating in the blackness outside the map. Terror missions seem to take place in a village located in bizzaro land where the houses are built into the side of never ending hills. There are 1 tile wide tunnels dotted around the map that exist for no other purpose than to make the mission harder.  The only postive thing I can say about this game is that the combat feels a lot better and is more challenging. However I think it sacrificed too much for it.  In conclusion, just play UFO defense with mods. The atmosphere as a whole is better and the bugs aren't game breaking.",-1,0

Gameplay , it will be some sort of DUMMBED down vbs version for consumers, better graphics (tbh i am ok even with vbs1) and less features.

It's accompanied by a suitable soundtrack that changes as the pace of the game fluctuates and once again gives you that immersive feel which will keep you playing for many hours.   On the whole, this game is well worth the RRP of $30 – The DLC I feel is a tad expensive for what you get and kind of spoils the game a little for me.

32800,,"Dear fellow gamer   After just 17 hours me and my friend finished a single playthrough of the game in co-op. We discovered something: this game is a must in co-op! We had loads of fun and we were frustrated more than once when we couldn’t kill a boss or troll. But in the end we got through and concluded that this game is more than awesome!! On the other hand we were let down by the final battle, which was simply tooooooo easy, since we had more difficulty defeating the first boss in the game.    THE STORY:  We were pleasantly surprised by the fact that the story is interwoven with the actual storyline of LOTR. You even come across characters as Aragorn, Gandalf, Lord Elrond, Legolas and Gloin (known from the Hobbit-trilogy) and even Frodo and Bilbo Baggins. You follow three companions (Eradan, Andriel and Farin) on their quest to defeat a minion of the dark lord Sauron. On their way they make several friends and stops in the north of Middle Earth.   GRAPHICS:  Not bad at all for a game that is already 4 years old. We saw a fair amount of detail on armours, buildings and the like and didn’t realise we were playing such an old game.   INTERFACE:  Convenient use of hotkeys and a useful minimap! The inventory was a little off, since you had very limited space and images for additional and trivial objects in the world of Middle Earth.   GAMEPLAY:  We found it very useful that you could see the name of your friends on screen even if they were in an entirely different place/room. A very useful feature of the game is that you have the option to exchange items with other players that are only suitable for that particular race. Conveniently enough there were several sell/buy/return to civilisation-points.  -  For the Ranger:  Very smooth movement of the character during a fight and one of the current reviewers enjoyed the swordplay a little too much at times. We liked the convenient switch between two-handed, one-handed, dual wielding and bow very useful. And, contrary to some other RPG’s, the realism of being attacked whilst you are looting or switching weapons was very satisfactory to us! We loved the critical, brutal, legendary, etc. strikes with the swords and headshots with the bow too. They lead to some pretty funny ways of dying! We would’ve loved an alternative attack with hotkey ‘2’ while using a two-handed sort, but that could just be because we didn’t unlock every skill in the skill tree. Conclusion; Eradan was a great ranger. -  For the Lore-master:  Andriel has some great abilities to use in combat, as a supportive mage. For example, she can conjure a magical shield that can protect you against arrows and magical blasts. She also can use her staff as a melee weapon, that is actually quite strong. Because of her Elven ancestry, Andriel can use herbs to fabricate potions to support herself or her companions. This can be decisive at some points in the game. -  For the Champion:  Not applicable (yet), but Farin is awesome!! He got us out of trouble more than once…more like a thousand times…LOL.    ALSO FUN;   - You can use your Eagle friend to do all the heavy work for you.  - You meet a dragon; Which seems to be very popular amongst gamers.  - Turrets!    Overall conclusion:   'The Lord of the Rings - War in the North' is a must have if you are a fan of the LOTR, RPG and/or co-op gaming, with a bit of hack &amp; slash in it. We had hours and hours of fun (and yet more to come) and we didn't get bored with the storyline once, even though all those trolls were a pain. Me and my friend decided that we definitely are going to play this game a few times each year... *Totally not addicted*   Enjoy the game!",1,1

374320,DARK SOULS™ III," TL;DR  - The concept is good. I love how the game conveys that this is ‘Dark Souls 3’. The gritty atmosphere, and the lore behind it, is attractive and interesting. However, the overall gameplay is a bit of disappointment. IMHO, the game is good for only the ‘FIRST’ playthrough.  PvP / Invading / Dueling is kind of nice, on paper, really, but it is actually kind of broken, when it comes to real thing.  Be warned, your first playthough can takes from 10-60 hours depending on your playstyle, however, your following playthrough can be finished much faster. (3-5 hours)  Feel likes more reading?

268420,Aura Kingdom,"This is a great f2p model.  Pros:  *Most paid features are purely cosmetic.  *Pretty nice graphics.  *Each class seems to play entirely different.  *Some quests are pretty creative.  *The community is nice.  *Bazillion amounts of in game achievements, for those of you who like that.  Cons: *When you reach certain levels, you'll sometimes automatically be given a quest. This is alright, except for the fact that a huge screen will pop-up to explain the quest to you, even if you happen to still be in combat. This really isn't so bad, I'm just holding a grudge because it caused me to die once.  *There's a lotta dudes on here that roll a female. I'm well aware this happens on every mmo, but I'm not kidding when it's normal to see female characters outnumber male characters 4:1 at times on this game. I personally don't really care about this, but this is just a fair warning to any fellow bros out there who may get seduced by internet 'women'  *Game just feels way too easy sometimes. At first it made me feel like I was a champ, but then I realized that I was getting to be a high level and the game is still giving me baby steps.  *My biggest gripe is the repetitiveness. The second area has a lot more shops than the first area, which is to be expected, and some of the new shops were pretty cool. The third area had the same exact shops, which I thought was fine. But then I get to the fourth area and realize that for the past 3 areas, aka 30 levels, the shops have been the same. Obviously the equipment was different, but it follows the same forumula (Area 2 sells Area 1 equipment and Area 2 equipment, Area 3 sells Area 2 equipment and Area 3 equipment, etc). At least up to level 40 there was not much variety in the equipment you get. I know at higher levels the loot is a bit different, but this was pretty annoying to me. --- Overall, this game is f2p and has some expected faults. However, being p2w is not a fault, as this game doesn't go by that. Any free game that I can put roughly 24 hours of enjoyed playing time into is fine by me. There will be plenty more hours to come.

225080,Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons,"Holy ♥♥♥♥, everyone needs to play this game. If you've played a lot of games, there's a lot to appreciate in the design department. It's all so smooth, it never explains anything, and yet it's so intuitive, nothing is ever unclear. This is true in the mechanics and also the story, as every character speaks gibberish. I'd also highly recommend it to people who don't play games, because it's incredibly accessible and one of the best arguments for games-as-art I've yet encountered. The story and the mechanics are blended so perfectly, each reinforcing the other. It's simply masterful. I wish I could write something even half as beautiful as this game.",1,0
345610,The Fruit of Grisaia,"Now, let's get this out of the way. I don't play Visual Novels, and I actively dislike most of Japanese entertainment offerings from games to anime and manga. So this review is from someone who is not in to this whole scene. I have also read the fan translated version, so my hours in this one don't actually reflect the true hours I've spent on this story.   One note, this is the 'no p0rn' version of the VN, and personally I think it only improves the story. The sex in the fan translated was mostly gratuitous and didn't really add anything useful to the story. I haven't played the story enough to say whether the censorship affected some of the jokes, however. Which would be a shame, because the adult jokes were often quite funny. But the sex scenes were useless. I'll have to get back to you about that.  For some reason, I just love this 'book'. It starts as a pure fluff comedy slice of life kind of thing, with slightly mysterious subtext. It helps to be aware of the Japanese stereotypes of 'kuudere' and 'tsundere', etc. for certain jokes. And make no mistake, there are a lot of jokes in this story.   You'll be laughing with tears in your eyes.  The game starts with a 'common route' where you make some fairly insignificant choices, and then finally you choose the girl you will be pursuing. Yes, the whole game is basically a romance, with the twist of all characters (including protagonist) being emotionally unstable and having usually huge psychological problems.  The game also makes a huge genre shift about 6 hours in, once you're done with the common route. The common route is absolutely hilarious comedy, the story then starts to slowly turn more serious and with less humor. Until you will be crying, and this time not because of laughter.  However, if you make right choices, you will be graced with a good ending, so there is always light at the end of the tunnel. Just warning you that there will be a lot of drama and it all will look very bleak.  There's only two dark spots on the VN and the main one is the presence of a loli. That is to say, the Makina route, which (should) give the creeps for anyone who isn't in to little girls. Yes, technically she's not much younger than Yuuji (the protagonist) but the route even plays up her youthful appearance. So, yes, it's disturbing. My advice for those who find lolis as disturbing phenomenon as I do, is to buy and play the VN but just... well, when Makina gives you money, refuse.  The second, but more of a minor problem, is the Michiru route. Because that sorely tests your suspension of disbelief. The premise of the whole route. The core of the issue... It's just pure and unadultered fantasy magic. But if you can swallow that, it's fine and often quite funny.  Among the best parts of the whole story is the protagonist Yuuji who is both a sarcastic badass, and hilariously unable to understand normal life.",1,0

The puzzles and the difficulty levels have been bumped up quite a bit and the game has evolved from a traditional console style game to a action packed movie style game. Has great voice acting. I was a bit weary when I heard Square Enix was involved but Square Enix is known for quality games and this one shows it. The full environmental interactivity in the game adds to the possibilities of how you can progress through the game , it seems there is more then one way to get through a portion of each part of the game. Going to be playing this more over the holiday weekend here in the USA, but if you are looking for something new Tomb Raider wise, I would pick this game up over Tomb Raider Legend - Its more fun to play.",1,0

223510,Miasmata,"Although i perhaps exaggerate now a little bit, but my personal opinion is, that Miasmata is a really astonishing masterpiece. The graphic quality almost reaches the standards of extremely expensive engines made by big companies, but is in fact made by just 2 guys. Surely it has some flaws, like the grainy looking water in the distance and no waves along the shores. The fog sometimes act a little bit strange and there are proplems like torches/sticks dont illuminate the logbook or map. But all of that is compensated by the incredible atmosphere. Starting extremely weak and as easy pray, you have to find water, plants and safe spots to survive. Creating medicine to keep you alive and to find the cure for the plague. Running around the island can be tricky sometimes, because the terrain affects your speed. It requires a lot of strenght to climb up a hill and you may stumble while running down, which causes a headache and in the worst case deadly high fever. Another great feature is, how you can create the map of the island. The easy method is to find pieces of the map around the camps. The other method is to draw a small piece of it by marking 2 known landmarks which are in sight. While exploring the island, you are watched by a creature lurking in the shadows of the Jungle, which will soon start to hunt you down. You dont have weapons and all you can do is to hide, distract the creature or run for you life. But there is one power you have, which will scare the beast away.",1,0

332800,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,"Honestly i like the game but once you've completed night 6 it gets boring. It was fun at around night 3 to 6 but the rest were either to easy or to hard.  Its way less scary than the last one; you know when your going to die. Also the animatronics scream isnt that menacing, the old scream was better. The Marionette wasnt a horrible idea, it just ruin the purpose of checking the cameras. Lastly i think you could have done a better job with golden freddy like when hes in your room all he does is slowly fade away, at least give him a jumpscare with his whole body.  If Scott does make a 3rd fnaf, heres an idea for it. Hav the main 4 characters Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy and maybe create another or something. But instead of sitting in a room all night give the player a chance to move around. Like once you completed the night shift you have to take a day shift and watch the animatronics.   Also a tip for you next fnaf are that you should make the jumpscares more unsespecting.  If you want this game, wait for the Christmas sale",-1,0

226320,Marvel Heroes Omega,"The most basic description would be Diablo with a Marvel theme, and that really tells you all you need to know about how it plays. Ignore the meta-gaming about who's the 'best' hero to play and just pick your favorite. This game is very dangerous to have installed. I keep finding myself loading it up instead of working on my backlog. The heroes are so varied in playstyle that it's the most fun I've ever had leveling up alts. If you played this when it first came out (sans the 2015 part of the name) you owe it to yourself to try it again. They've made massive improvements since its launch. Most of the voice acting is great, and none of it is bad (some lines do get annoying due to repetition, but that happens in every game). The free-to-play element is really set up well. The only thing you'll really feel like you need to spend money is extra storage space, but the game is so well done that I don't begrudge them for it. Their hard work deserves to be rewarded somehow. Update: Even more fun and addictive now. Some very intriguing changes going to happen soon too.",1,0

48700,Mount & Blade: Warband,"Mount &amp; Blade: Warband (along with its predecessor, Mount &amp; Blade) is a game so unique it is difficult to fit it snugly into one category. It's an action RPG, it's grand strategy, it's a simulation, it's open world. This game is a whole bunch of things that melt so perfectly together, and it is unlike any other game I've ever played. For anyone who is even the slightest bit interested in medieval warfare, this is the game you never knew you wanted.  You start out by answering some simple questions about the life your character has lived thus far, and critiquing the way your heroine (or hero) looks. You are thrown into the large continent of Calradia which is split into six unique factions that are constantly at war with each other. The world map is familiar to those of us who enjoy grand strategy games; you can view the land and the castles/towns/villages/hideouts etc. that exist on it at any one time, while your character and her horse moves along it like a pawn on a gameboard. The colors of the names tell you which faction currently owns and controls each piece of land. What you begin to do from here is ultimately up to you. You can try doing favors for lords and kings to win their favor and ultimately work for them, whilst building up a small army of ragtag soldiers that you recruit and hire from various places, or you can be bold and try almost immediately to begin taking over land yourself (which I wouldn't recommend for the first dozen or so hours into the game).  Battles in this game are nothing short of amazing. Both warring sides start out on opposite ends of the map (I've never seen the same battlefield twice, by the way, so I believe they are randomized based on the terrain type you are currently traversing). You can issue commands to your army, and this is fun to mess around with. For example, you can tell your archers to stand their ground and your cavalry to charge the enemy, while giving a different order to infantry. It's all up to you. By default, all units will charge, and for the most part, this is sufficient. You will then meet your enemy in the battlefield, where cavalry can run over infantry, archers can shoot riders off of horses, and you can kill horses while their riders are still living, making them fall face first into the ground before swarming them. Basically, if you've ever seen two opposing sides charge in a movie and have felt that intensity and awe, you can actually play as one of those people involved in Mount &amp; Blade, and each and every time it's amazing. This game is fantastic for nerds like me who love anything medieval; not only are there full out battles like this, but you eventually (and your army) get strong enough to take over castles, towns, etc., and you get to be one of the units that is a part of this, each and every single time.  The goal regardless seems to be to take over the entire map of land, whether through an existing faction or through your own, which you may create once you have a strong enough army to begin taking over land by force. Lords will double cross you, downright insult you, and even beg their respective kings for the rights to a castle you may have taken over yourself, and depending on the circumstance, you may or may not be jipped out of a piece of land you worked hard for. You can then, however, decide to accept that or give a one fingered salute to your king before renouncing your allegiance and going your own way. It is entirely up to you.  I would highly, highly recommend you play as a woman character, even if you are not a woman in real life. The game is fantastic at reflecting the negative attitudes toward women at the time, and those mentalities can highly influence you during the game. For example, I created a woman character and named her after myself, much like I did for the first Mount and Blade. I set about leveling up my character and recruiting soldiers, and picked up a mercenary contract for a faction. After taking over three castles single-handedly for the faction's king, I spoke to the king, introduced myself, and asked to be promoted to being his vassal. He told me outright that he didn't care what I had accomplished. Because I was a woman, I could not be his vassal, and I couldn't own land. I asked him what would happen if I took an enemy castle by force, and he replied that he would 'think about' letting me keep it. This sexist attitude (although very realistic for the time) got me so fired up that I promptly cancelled my contract with the king and began taking over his land by force. After about 40 hours of in-game time, he was exiled from the land, his faction was extinct, and all of his land belonged to a new faction appropriately named 'Rosie's Kingdom of Awesome.' About 40 hours after that, I was Queen of Calradia. But it all started because of my motivation to overthrow an arrogant and sexist king as the woman he insulted, and no other game has done such a great job of inspiring me to create my own grudges and follow through on them until I conquered all.   This game is one of the most perfectly put together pieces of work I've ever played. I've seen people question the graphics, but I think the game is simplisticly beautiful (also, I grew up in the 90s--graphics don't matter to me). The game runs perfectly on my older non-gaming laptop, so that's also a plus for those of you looking for a large scale warfare game that can play on a toaster. There are some glitches, although nothing game-breaking (people spawned on the outside of a castle wall in 2/500 or so sieges I played, and I once had to sit out one siege because I fell through a crack in a floor of a castle tower and floated perpetually until my soldiers won the battle without me and I could exit). The character animations are a bit stiff, but I actually like them that way; it brings humor to the game for me, and if any future Mount &amp; Blade doesn't have the stiff animations, I'll miss them.  Mount &amp; Blade: Warband took 90 hours of my life away in the past week, and very few games can pull me in so relentlessly. This game is one of my personal favorites, along with Mount &amp; Blade (I haven't tried With Fire &amp; Sword yet, but it's only a matter of time). A solid 10/10 from me. Buy this game. Buy it now, and let it consume you. :)",1,0
227580,"10,000,000","10,000.000 is a very difficult game to discribe as it has multiple genres and elements into it, so it is hard to put be specifc in its genre, so apolagese for any confusion that may happen while you read this.  You are a person who appears to trapped in a prison or dungeon and must collect 10,000,000 (points I guess) to escape. However you can't just simply add on the points you have to constantly beat your score to win by not letting the left side of the wall catch up to you. There are also challenges to help you as well but completing them can be awfully obnoxious.  So the gameplay itself is a puzzle/RPG, you have to match tiles to either get resources for building new structres, attack enemies, use magic, get keys to unlock chests and doors and complete challenges to either earn more points or gain gold to make stronger items or train to gain new abilities.   I haven't completed the game myself because to be honest tile games don't interest me very much. This one though I have made an acception of playing either when I am waiting for something to download or just when I am in the mood for matching tiles. It is also something even your family could probably play and have interest in, but the only way that would happen is if we destroyed Facebook and all the other freegames on it! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  To anyone who has read this please excuse any mistakes that you see in this post.

252030,Valdis Story: Abyssal City,"I typically enjoy Metroidvania games. But let me be perfectly clear here when I say that 'enjoy' does not describe how much I actually love this game. It has the perfect mix of platforming, combat, exploration, and RPG elements all woven into one great game with some beautiful artwork and soundtracks.   One of the best features in my opinion is the choice of 4 unique characters, all of which get their own unique playstyle and weapons. I find that this highly increases the diversity of the game because you'll find yourself able to approach each situation the game has to throw at you in different ways. Whether you prefer to focus on spellcasting, ranged combat, close range melee combat, or really want to hone in on lengthy combo's, this game has a character for you.  The customization of playstyle doesn't even stop there, as the RPG type levelling system allows you to pick skills from different skill trees, and level up in different stats to further customize that character to your own unique niche, which will be further complimented with the character exclusive weapons that you'll be able to pick up along the way and use from the getgo in your next playthrough.  The replayability factor is incredible, and the combat is fun meaning that I do not find it a chore to start a game fresh. Even on normal difficulty, you'll probably find yourself challenged in the same way that classic games did. Challenging enough to not be boring, but not so difficult that you'll want to fling the game across the room.   If by the sound of this review, you feel that this game suits your interests, I highly recommend that you pick it up. It will not disappoint.",1,0

More fighting Level 9s and Premiums.  Conquest mode would be the best for farming because of the amount of G you can get from Capturing Points alone, until you realize very, VERY few people play Conquest.  So after much more than just a few hours, you buy your Parts from the store, and now you can have fun killing the new players and having a fair fight against the High Levels, and a still unfair fight against Premiums.

I mean for starters it's free, second, you are not forced to buy the 'special in-game currency' before you are able to continue, in gameplay and as a plus, everything that can be bought with 'special in-game currency' can be bought with the 'standardin-game currency'. That being said, this game does involve a decent amount of grind, especialy if you want to obtain the better vehicles/gear. so beware that fact.  P.S. as a side note, the minimum requirements for the game are a bit off in my findings, unless you realy insist on playing at 12 frames using 3 gigs of RAM.

226860,Galactic Civilizations III,"A great 4X game all in all - Although you may want to hold off a bit if you're coming from it's predecessor, Galactic Civilizations 2. It is still a bit barebones in some areas like Diplomacy/Espionage but they seem committed to adding all of those features down the road as free content patches while expanding on existing mechanics through DLC and Expansions.  Is it fun? Yes, definitely.  Is it pretty? As pretty as you can expect a 4X to be - And then some.  Replayability? Oh yes - You can create your own races with unique traits and give them personalities so the AI will play them as you intended. The game also features a very robust Ship Designer tool, which lets you design your own ships from scratch. The sheer size of the larger maptypes means you can create games that will potentially last you for weeks - Not unlike that of Distant Worlds with up to (and potentially beyond) a hundred or more unique races provided your hardware is up to the task.  Campaign - In a 4X? I'm not entirely sold on this concept - While it works in some games better than others, it is definitely more of a lore introduction / tutorial campaign than a full on campaign as you would expect from a series like Heroes: Might and Magic, or Age of Empires. It's short but serves as a great springboard into the meat and potatoes of the game - Sandbox games.  On a final note - The developers are very active with the community, taking lots of feedback and suggestions from forum posts and livestream comments. These are definitely people who care about the genre and the game - It's not just about the bottom line.",1,1

The gameplay did not get boring at all and the side quests were enjoyable.

It has light Metroid exploration type gameplay with a mix of NES Double Dragon thrown in. The story wasn't anything too special but it wasn't bad and did a good job of moving things along.

The mission structure is by the books Call of Duty style: move forward, stop, kill a million enemies, move forward a bit and do the same. However, what elevates it above other military shooters is the story.  You're deployed to Dubai -- or what's left of it -- on a mission to locate survivors of a cataclysmic sandstorm. Simple enough, right? It would be, if not for the war raging within. As you explore the ruins of Dubai, questions are raised. How far is too far? Is the pursuit of your mission worth it, in spite of the casualties along the way?  If a thought-provoking story is of interest to you, I strongly recommend Spec Ops. On the other hand, if you are simply looking to kill people with abandon, you're best to look elsewhere. Whilst the shooting is solid, it can't carry the game and actually becomes tedious towards the end. ",1,0

The story picks up some time after the first game and is packed with a new story and cast of enemies and allies, with familiar faces from the first game making a come-back. The game possesses significantly less 'adventure fantasy' elements than the first game although they are not entirely gone. This was actually the first game of the series I played and though its story is more or less able to stand alone, it is even better when you have played the first beforehand. Included in a relatively cheap bundle with the first game this game is a gem at a bargain of a price.",1,0

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"Waste of money.  90's graphics and 80's gameplay. Not the worst game I've bought on steam but definately that half of the scale. Save your money!  UPDATE : After the overwhelming posite reviews I thought I'd put a bit of effort in, thinking maybe I missed something. No, didn't miss much. I can positively absolutely confirm that this game IS A LOW QUALITY CRAP GAME!   Update 2: After trying to play this crap again for over an hour.  Here is a grown up point of view. The graphics are horrible. A 12 year old could draw better grahics. A circle, box and 4 lines is the main character.   O [ ]--   | \ Most of the enemies are stick figures or bouncing circles of different colors.  Gameplay is near pointless and resembles that of the 80's arcade. Same thing endlessly! Randomly generated rooms with random doorways. You can't aim properly, and minor obstacles stop you in your tracks and often prevent you from obtaining the keys etc. This leads to many times being unable to continue as until you kill all the circles, squares of squiggly lines and get the key you can't move on in some rooms. The music is just annoying and after a very short time will be turned off. The sound effects are definately low tech and appear to be an after thought Many time you end up with nowhere to go so you have to start again like I've stated and the boss levels are ridiculously hard and make no sense. Shoot them 50 times they shooot you twice. Your dead! The younger players seem to like it as the endless reviews like 'Awsome game', 'Really Fun', 'Best game ever' 'Funnest game' etc showing that it does have a place for children or those children at heart. Hmmmm! If you are over 12, and want a little bit of intellectual game play then AVOID THIS! IF YOU ARE 12 or less age wise or have the mentality of herpies and are looking for a button masher, random generated 80's style, poorly executed, dungeon game that requires just simply randomly walking around shooting circles or triangle or stick figures then BUY THIS GAME or get your mummy and daddy to buy it for you! Its cheap for a reason! If you do like the 80 style monotonous type games then there is far better games than this, and far better value.",-1,0

218620,PAYDAY 2,"A very fun game, but don't enter into it without some knowledge of the style of FPS that this game is. The casing/stealth, and loud styles of play are very different. Playing with people you know that are careful and methodical to play through a mission loaded lightly and stealthily to get the big pay off without firing a shot is immensely rewarding, but it really is difficult to do with random internet partners. Loading heavy for a firefight is fun also, and it is what you'll get the majority of games.  The rank up mechanic is a bit strange, as you need to play to earn both XP and money, but the real value of playing is to get cards which enable you to buy further weapon mods. An unmodified gun is not half as good as one loaded up with goodies, whether you go loud or quiet.  Keep with it though, its a fun game at a great price point, with lots of replayability.",1,0

I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games. Only real problem is later puzzle can be frustrating just becuase they require percision. Also it has great boss battles even thought there is only a couple they are very memorable. I beat the game in about 5 hours bu it has collectables which the game hits at a secret ending if u collect them all. Even though it's kinda short this game in my opinion is well worth it.,1,0

263060,Blockstorm,"Well well well. This game in short is Ace of Spades revived with a big focus on gameplay along the lines of Counter Strike 1.6 and Half Life 1 Multiplayer. It really is great fun and the graphics kind of give it a charm that makes it feel like it comes straight out of 1998 or something. The block based levels are great, giving you tons of ways to play a match for example literally pumping a 100 bullet mag into a wall just so other people don't have the cover of said wall anymore. Of course you can also place blocks yourself, building small walls to crouch behind when you reload.  Basicly if you like Counter Strike-ish games with a little twist this sure is a game to pick up, especially now when its on sale.  And the editor where you can make maps, skins for your weapons and for your characters is  amazing . Easy to use for everyone and so many options to be creative with.

However, although from what i have seen so far Fallout 4 is not that bad a game, it is just not really Fallout seeing as the majority of the RPG elements have been removed.  Yes, crafting has been introduced, but reducing dialogue to 4 options, dumbing down the skill tree by removing all the percentages and making perks to be the actual level up.(The idea of a perk was a bonus, above the standard level up). Along with the removal of the percentages also are the Tag skills. Overall, a dumbed down, console friendly Fallout Lite.",-1,0

Beware the shadow people, they will kill you just as quickly as the hat man, and they spawn in random locations.

You are given countless ways to approach a situation with a great degree of control, and this makes for some truly memorable moments. However I feel that the story has suffered under the wheels of the Hype train. The game clearly is unfinished, with huge sections of story missing. Big boss throughout the entire game channels Gordon Freeman more than the cocky Jack we met in Operation Snake Eater. Other characters are either underused or underdeveloped.  On top of that, the ending twist while interesting leaves much to be desired and creates more questions than answers.   Overall great gameplay but a disappointing story.",1,0

241560,The Crew,"Edit (2016) They have sold a 'complete edition' when there is more content on the way, so you can pay once for the game with the season pass, pay again for the content that doesn't come in the season pass, then pay one more time for more content not included to be released. To hell with this game.   Edit (4/25/2015) : They added a few new cars and some specs, fixed some bugs and managed to improve the main menu with a slideshow and the online matchmaking with a merge-all lobby system. Perhaps it's enough of a change for you to enjoy this game? Me, I checked and played the 'new' content for a few hours and unninstalled it again, personally I can't find any improvement worth a buyback into this game since my gripe is the terrible driving mechanics alongside the bad physics. I remain true to every word I wrote in this review.   I had high hopes for this game, I played the betas, followed the forums and pre-ordered it. Then I forced myself to like it and play it even after I was completely frustrated by everything I'm about to say.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME AT IT'S CURRENT STATE AND/OR PRICE TAG.  Before the ugly : THE CREW is not a complete mess, there is the possibility of having a great amount of fun playing this game depending on what kinda of player you are. One thing it gets right is the map diversion. Every spot, every city or zone as they say, has it's own feeling and design, it's unique, and driving around the map with a friend is sure entertaining. but that's it. if you're not the person who enjoys cross country trips or american cars, there is not much for you here.   Entitled as 'MMO CAR-PG' but you can't develop your character, not a single aspect. In theory, every player has the same exact character, solution? Let's hide other player's driver. and that's it. Let's say you play against remote controlled cars, for immersion's sake. you CAN'T call it an mmo, without character development, the best you'll get are perks, nothing really groundbreaking. but we have cars, don't we?  There are 30~40 cars and all of them seem unfinished, except for the first ones. because you know, 'first impressions are always the most important'. the first five cars have all the specs available, street, dirt, performance, raid and circuit. other cars usually have 2~3 specs only. so you wanna go crazy off road with that expensive car? too bad. also, most cars are American, so no luxury here. what's most stupid is the unbalanced performance cars have, the starter vehicles run faster then the most expensive car in the game.   But driving gets better as your car and player level increases, right? No. That's an excuse for the handling in the game. It doesn't get better. I have 1299 ( Max level ) cars and with assistance off, they just don't grip on the road as the default low level mustang does. With assistance on, it's just 'drifting'. The crew should have stayed as a street racing game only, the street tracks are okay, the handling on street is OK. but when it goes off-road becomes soap ( and not in a good 'Dirt game' way of soap ), on circuit the game just doesn't have enough decent physics to feel solid, and while climbing mountains with raid spec... I wish you good luck trying not to roll 900º in the air after hitting that small rock. this game is unpredictable thanks to it's physics, you never know how is your car going to react to crashes so expect for the worst and try avoiding collisions. worth adding : some elements break, some doesn't, and in this game this is not okay because when someone tries to cut their way trough some houses, the fences breaks. When you're doing the turn on a corner, well, the fence it very likely to be the most solid virtual object you'll ever find.   Progression is BROKEN, I had to try various missions at least three times due to disconnects that WIPED my progress, my statistics are currently like this ' main missions complete : 167% ', and the rewards are ridiculously unbalanced. Let me explain this : I leveled from 1 to 50 in ONE DAY AND A HALF doing no more than 60 PvP matches, 10 or so story missions and some exploration. Yes, I reached maxed level on an MMO in basically a day. It gets better, I was being rewarded 16k bucks every time I finished first on a PvP match, and when you are disqualified because you couldn't get to the finish line in time, well, TAKE THESE 16K BUCKS ANYWAY. You just know they didn't really put any thought into the game's progression when all it takes from level 49 to 50 is 2 races in 10 minutes.   The customization feels incomplete, some categories are there with no parts to purchase for you car, get used to the 'No part available in this category' message. the stickers are single color only and there isn't variety among those, expect to see everyone using the same 2 flame stickers or racing stripes. the real car performance parts are available with a grind of challenges after level 50 which is not very cool given the insane difficulty of some challenges, but don't worry, it doesn't matter how fast your car is... AI CHEATS, it goes off track and spawns in front of you, It rams you constantly and the Catch-up is ridiculous. there are some gifs on Polygon's review of the crew if your interested.   The story is not good, you bounce trough one generic dialog to the next and I couldn't connect to any character of this game, I couldn't care less to be honest and not skipping cutscenes was a challenge at times. At the end of the main story you are rewarded with a mix of every CGI they made for the game, which felt very very lazy.  And I could go on, there is the server instability problem, the always online 'DRM', the NAT problem that causes online atrocities, the lack of mirrors promised by launch, no weather system, the 'crew joining different lobbies' bug, the 'Hitting someone back at 20mp/h and flying like when hit by a giant on skyrim' bug, the 'I regret the money I spent buying this game' case and the first time I actually emailed steam support to ask about their refund policy.   I'm frustrated. I just wish I could go back to those TDU2 Times.   tl;dr  + Every area is unique and has it's own feeling. + Driving with friends can be fun  Edit (4/25/2015) : - A 2014 Racing game Lacking mirrors, promised by launch - Server instability, constant disconnections and progress Wipes - AI CHEATS - Incomplete customization ( Specs were added ) - Not a great amount of cars ( Cars were added )  - Unbalanced car performances - Terrible car handling - Physics make for an unpredictable game - Broken progression system - Broken statistics system - Unbalanced reward system - Outdated graphics ( They fixed DoF at some camera angles ) - Fake car engines - No photo mode - Cliche, generic storyline - Only 7 players on Screen - Season Pass could have been part of the game  - TERRIBLE Online pvp lobby system ( Now fixed )",-1,1

241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ is not a game i would normally buy or play. The reviews compared it to the Batman Arkam games and they never appealed so why did i buy this title. Honestly no idea. I think i got it for 50% of during the steam holiday sale but my opinion now would be even at full price this game would be worth the money. The game runs smooth, the action can be breathtaking. The scenery can be a bit samey after a while but half way through it opens up anew area which is a tad greener :) There's a mission you can play early on where you go to one of the strongholds and you have to defeat 100 uruks, when i first tried this i got pumped big time but a few unlocks later and you look forward to those battles with relish. My biggest worry was the controls, as i'm getting on a bit now (middle aged is the term) I honestly can't be bothered with learning multiple button presses combined to create a certain type of attack or defense. Fortunatly the game glides you in gently meaning it's pretty basic early on and it's only as the game progresses that you have these additional features where a press of E here or R there pulles of some amazing manouver. I'm now over 30 hours in and about 70% through the game and i'm dreading the fact i'm closing in on the end. I can only say i highly recommend this, it's fun it's enthralling and it's worth the money.",1,0
24980,Mass Effect 2 (2010),"Better than Mass Effect 1. I am probaly one of the nine people in the world who think so but seriously, I don't have any idea to as why people like the original more! I know everybody claims ME2 isn't an RPG but it is really just as much of an RPG as the first one, with a few exceptions. Sure, they dumbed down a few things but there is still complete exploration, a decent amount of side quests and a leveling system.   The characters in this game are far superior than the ones that occupied the first. I was happy to see Tali and Garrus come back for those were easily my favorites. Wrex was killed off in my first game so I didn't end up meeting back up with him. Just everything about the new supporting cast was great and I didn't find any of them to be bland or boring, except maybe Legion, who shows up later and the game and doesn't have much time for character development.   The final moments in this game are some of the most epic ♥♥♥♥ I have ever laid my eyes upon.

204450,Call of Juarez Gunslinger,"As far as story driven FPS games go Call of Juares is as good as they get. This is a game that essentially is a story and at times feels like its many stories at the same time. It’s got very solid gunplay, the art style and westerns setting are very well done. An interesting take on bullet time adds another layer to the game play and the nuggets of truth are  In fact western lore - a very nice touch that adds a little bit of depth to the characters. So as you might have figured, a lot of positives going for the game.  On the downside, the lack of different weapons is a shame. Basically you have a few types of revolvers, a few shotguns and a few rifles. All of the guns feel nice and make a nice sound but within each category the weapons feel pretty much the same. So essentially you only really have like 3 weapons.  As far as the story goes - it’s a guns blazing western fantasy. A fun story but nothing to write home about. The way it's presented though is really great.  The game took about 12,5 h to complete on hard and there are still challenge modes to go through and duels to have. The duel mode is also a nice addition to the game but I can say I did not have as much fun with it as I thought I would.  'A' for effort though.

It has everything a good zombie survival game needs; big maps, scarce supplies, great atmosphere, a tinge of realism, and most importantly: lots and lots of zombies posing a great threat to anyone who comes unprepared!  It has many similarities with Left 4 Dead (scavange for supplies, fight zombies, and escape), and yet it's so much different. One could argue that this is better in terms of realism, and required skill, but I'd say it depends on what you're looking for in a zombie survival game.  If you want a fast-paced, action-packed, that gives you a sense of victory and greatness: it's Left 4 Dead. But if want a game that gives you a sense of desperation and actual hopelsessness: it's this. In other words: Left 4 Dead is like Resident Evil (without Umbrella and it's dodgy shenanigans), while No More Room In Hell is like a gool 'ol zombie horror movie (or The Walking Dead).",1,0

The trade system is very restrictive at present, but IMC is considering options to alleviate that and make trade a little more open. The current overly restrictive system came about due to efforts to hinder RMT bots/groups. We will have to wait and see what IMC plans to do.  The class system is interesting and IMC has made some interesting decisions with some of these classes.

204220,Snapshot,"As another reviewer pointed out, If you look at the global gameplay stats, it becomes clear very few people have played this one beyond the first section. Before looking at this I had the insane idea of trying to complete the time trials, get the hidden object and collect all the stars in each stage. The time trial times are completely unforgiving and after the 10th or 11th level the tedium made me want to stop completely and just play the levels without getting anything. But at that point the frustration had set in and every new level made me think, who in their right minds would bother will all this?  The level of precision needed to even complete some levels (specifically, bouncing and snapping up the item just after you've bounced) finally did me in. Games this difficult need to give you a reason to continue, more than the vainglory of proving to the world that you could 100% Snapshot. As far as I could tell, collecting stars, pictures of the special items in each level, and completing the time trials gives you nothing. We are not living in the days of the NES where money and game options are limited. When frustration and overwhelmedness are the core emotions a game provokes, it is time to put your pride in your knapsack and move on to the next world with the dream that somewhere out there love awaits.

233290,MURDERED: SOUL SUSPECT™,"If you like games such as L.A Noire and Sherlock Holmes this should be right up your alley. It is different from those games though, because this is you solving your own crime. That means your a ghost, wandering around the town looking for clues. I would say this is a very unique game, and that's rare these days.  Gameplay wise it's simple, look around for clues, draw a conclusion and go to the next place. it's very interesting because you are a ghost and you can simply walk through walls. However you cant go through solid buildings, unless someone opens the door for you. You can also use abillities like poltergeist, mind control and even take over a cat.   This game is extremely story heavy, and the story is really intresting. It kept me coming back until I was done. Even the simple sidequests really intrigued me and made me want to collect every little collectible I could find.  About 1,5 hour of the game is cutscenes and the others are gameplay. It's not that long of a game, but I would actually say this was the perfect lenght. It didn't overstay its welcome and drag out for to long. The story was exciting all the way through, and you could never figure out who it was until the end.   A lot of plot twists in this game, which reminded me of Heavy Rain. The story is great thanks to impressive cutscenes and good voice acting. Any downsides with this game? Only that the demons and the elements were quite repetitive, but that isn't that big of a complaint since the game didn't go on for that long, and I can clearly see that they put the work on cutscenes and story instead.   I really enjoyed my time in this dark and gritty town. This is a game that everyone should play at some point in my honest opinion, it's that damn good. I really hope they will make a sequel or something along those lines.",1,1

260230,Valiant Hearts: The Great War™ / Soldats Inconnus : Mémoires de la Grande Guerre™,"Valiant Hearts is a powerful story about how four peoples' lives are affected by The Great War. It is so rare to see coverage of the First World War, and it is especially appropriate given that nearly 100 years ago, the war was started.  First, some nuts-and-bolts: the game uses Uplay. I am sorry if this is a negative to you, but it is how it works. The game also have full controller support (at least for the XBox360 controller), which doesn't seem to be listed anywhere. The prompts are also in XBox360.  The characters are all fairly likeable, omitting some spoilers. Emile, an older gentlemen pressed into service, is most certainly NOT a soldier at the beginning of the game - and it shows. Freddie seems to be the game's action hero, who is getting called into battle and 'saves the day' for however long the war will let him. Anna is a nurse who seems to be able to solve any problem, no matter the cost. Karl is the unfortunate resident drafted by the German army, interrupting his family life. Finally, there is Walt, who you discover shortly into the game and will help you solve many puzzles - and loves to be petted!  Freddie seems to be a little on the weak side out of the cast. His story makes sense, but the game doesn't go into much detail on the reasons he's in the war. A lot of the focus is (rightfully) given on Karl's problem, to make the war seem real. Anna and Emile definitely round out the main cast extremely well, and I definitely appreciated the little animations when Anna does her thing on the battlefield. Walt, the dog, is understandably thin on character. He's mostly there to drive the game along, because many puzzles require his use. He does get a moment or two very late in the game, however.  Mechanically, the game is very fluid. I encountered no bugs nor crashes. 'War' scenes play out similarly to a side-scroller, dodging machine gun fire and bombs/mortars. 'Puzzle' scenes take place in a limited area, where you have to manipulate the environment using levers, wheels, platforms, or throw items to activate things. The 'war' scenes definitely fit in with the plot, as the first few I was thinking 'Wow, this is war' to 'Wow, this is horrible!' along with the plot. There are a couple of 'Boss' fights as well, with a villain created for the story. These scenes are timed and play out like a 'puzzle' scene. Dying at any point in the game, whether on the field, to a boss, or failing a puzzle, just respawns you at the previous checkpoint. It does break immersion somewhat, however it minimizes the frustration, as you don't tend to respawn all that far from whatever killed you. The one thing that kept annoying me was having to hold the button to activate wheels and levers, and sometimes the wheel turning was a little slower than I anticipated.  Graphically, the game is fantastic, looking much like a comic strip using UbiArt. You can see other soldiers racing into battle during the 'war' scenes behind the main line and their untimely fates... Sometimes objects required for puzzles DO get hidden, like background objects, but there is always a way to solve the puzzle by experimenting. The music and the sound were also great, never taking away from the feel of the game.  Difficulty-wise, the game isn't too hard. Death is resolved by the nearest checkpoint, and some puzzles do allow some room for error. Each character has different puzzle types, with Emile digging, Anna saving people, and Karl doing some trading. There are also a couple of scenes of your car dodging incoming (and oncoming!) obstacles. Anna's puzzles are mostly rhythm-based, and are pretty forgiving with their button prompts. It is unfortunate that your attention is at the top of the screen, rather than on the actions she's taking. A couple of puzzles were tricky, but like all good adventure games, you tend to go 'Ah, I should have though of that!'. Hints are available, 1 minute at a time, however I only had to use hints two or three times at all.  There isn't that much replay, unfortunately. There are 100 collectibles to find throughout the chapters, but each collectible has a bit of a historical remark, such as soldier Dog Tags or Gas Masks. There are also some historical notes on events, such as POW Camps and important battles, along with links to MISSION CENTENAIRE 14-18 and Apocalypse: 10 Lives (both what I assume to be coverage of World War 1). The game does flow with the events of World War 1 for the most part, however it does not show the war's resolution (which is probably outside the scope of the game?). But I definitely got a sense of the impact of the war, even if it is only limited to the France-Germany border.  Overall, the game is beautifully done and I WANTED to finish it and resolve the story. My playtime is about 6 hours for a first playthrough, without finding all the collectibles (maybe around 70% found). The message at the end is very powerful and shows, with great respect, the impact of the people of the war. It is a bittersweet game, where you will laugh at the silly stuff but MAYBE cry at the sad things (the ending was what really got me). I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this game.",1,0
228260,Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes,"Seems kind of decent but the clunky interface pushes me away. Customization optons seem broad but shallow, of the 'here are 50 different +1s' style. The game is front-loaded with annoyances like learning an interface that is slightly off in every way, being offered city positions where you cannot build any buildings, and dealing with wandering monsters vastly stronger than your starting troops. Other reviews suggest that it blossoms in the mid/late game once you get used to all that, then becomes tedious in a drawn-out endgame or with trivial difficulty once you master the options, so I do not feel compelled to get over the initial hurdle.  'Hard to learn, easy to master' is not a good design goal.",-1,1

Complaints: third person takedowns and climbing, very limited floor types and non existent sound travel for footsteps, incredibly small level design and hub map, lack of the original voice actor who is far superior as Garrett and a terrible combat system.  This game may have been saved by taking the Thief developers and water boarding them until they understood what gamers mean with the word 'immersion'.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"I bought the game outside of steam and only paid around 46$ I dont think buying GTA V within steam is the best of ideas because of the 70$ (CAD) that we need to spend. So if youre really interested in getting the game, you could just use special bundle sites such as HumbleBundle or GreenManGaming. Both sites give great offers and with the 23% discount going on right now you could get the game for even cheaper. Overall the game is fun and probably gives more than 1000 hours of gameplay (UNTIL THE GAME GETS BORING). If you want a different GTA experience this is what youre looking for. But switching around settings is very limited, so if you dont know if your computer can handle it DO NOT PURCHASE.  SUMARY: I recommend this game OUTSIDE of steam and only if you know your PC can handle it. Very small mod support, but it comes with a built in cheatcode operation system. Only get the game on steam if you really care about fully suppoerting the game....  -ZInC",1,0

46480,Still Life,"This game is a follow up to Post Mortem, and introduces a second playable storyline involving FBI agent Victoria McPherson. She is investigating a string of grisly murders in Chicago and this ties in to a case her grandfather, Gustav 'Gus' McPherson worked whilst in 1920s Prague.   It is a simple point-and-click type game that involve some rather puzzling puzzles to be solved along the way. The story itself is reasonably interesting, but the character development and voice acting are somewhat lacking. The ending seems to raise more questions than it gives answers, but it is, on the whole, an enjoyable game to play. The soundtrack/score by Tom Salta is particularly well-crafted, working brilliantly to convey the atmosphere of a scene.  ",1,0
239840,Dead State,"This is the zombie apocalypse game that I always wished existed. I LOVE 'anyone can die' type games. And for the first two weeks or so, anyone could and DID die. The country bumpkin deputy fell first...the trucker mom and I had to abandon him as we ran for our lives from a hardware store.  Then the IT nerd and the trucker mom's daughter were killed at the national park when we tried to split up to survive a horde.  Then the trucker mom and the tough cop got caught in the middle of a shootout between rival gangs. Between the gunfire and the zombies that were attracted to it, it became a blood bath. In addition to the trucker mom and the tough cop dying, the flight attendant with PTSD got bit. She killed herself that night.  Then the televangelist got jumped...there was no way for us to get to him in time.   Finally, there was nobody left except myself and a young naive farmer girl. We were doomed.  Until we stumbled onto the scene of a car wreck, where a gay former Army Ranger agreed to join our group. That was the turning point. Once he was on my team, things got much easier. We still lost the occasional member from time to time, including one of my survivors murdering another one, but all in all we grew to about 30-40 survivors - each with a unique skill set, backstory, All along the way, I was making hard decisions that affected the rest of the group. I did eventually lead the team to safety, and it definitely felt earned.  I will make one complaint, and it's one you don't hear a lot: This game takes FOREVER to beat. A ridiculously long time. I'd say the first 50% was a real nail-biter where I was loving every second of it. Then the next 20% I was starting to feel a little OP, but still liking the game. Then the last 30% becomes 'JESUS CHRIST WHEN DOES THIS GAME END???'  It gets very repetitive in the last 20-30 hours or so, and every single battle...regardless of whether it's zombie hordes or major human 'bosses', becomes a cakewalk.   But even with that pacing complaint, this is still a phenomenal game and I highly recommend it for anyone who likes the feeling of the lives and deaths of dozens and dozens of characters depending on you for survival.",1,1

266840,Age of Mythology: Extended Edition,"Fans of this classic Microsoft game will appreciate the new Extended Edition. It includes many graphical updates which makes the game much more playable than the older version, and it also includes the amazing Titans expansion which adds unique gameplay elements. The campaign has a nice plot and varied settings to keep you hooked, and there are plenty of interesting unit types not seen in other RTS games. Local multiplayer is extremely fun and a total blast from the past. I recommend picking this game up if you have fond memories of the original, or if you are just looking for a good RTS game to play with some buddies.",1,0

432020,,"A hardcore clicker, very challenging for you have to keep your rythm at over 180cpm constantly from the start to the finish with tiny breaks for simple secondary tasks (with WASD) or while the levels load - yep, no saves, no pauses, levels start instantly, a small mistake in timing and you start from the very beginning. No feeling of satisfaction when your character shoots his fireworks - just a 2 second break to take a deep breath before the new run. This gameplay idea is original among others in the genre, but the design feels so ugly.. I know the South Park stupidity style suits the concept, still even in these boundaries you can do much better. The main compliant is the monotony of the process - the random interfering encounters and funny achievements get old very quickly, the need to start it all over for the 100th time is barely justified.  Сложная щелкалка, бросает вызов в том плане, что нужно поддерживать ритм свыше 180 щелчков в минуту от начала до конца (хе-хе) с перерывчиками на простые побочные задания (при помощи WASD), либо на загрузку уровней - да, никаких сохранений, пауз, уровни стартуют мгновенно, малейшая неточность по времени нажатия и начинай по новой. Нет чувства удовлетворения от салютов главного героя - лишь 2-хсекундный перерыв, чтобы вздохнуть перед очередным забегом. Идея довольно оригинальна среди собратьев по жанру, но дизайн крайне уродлив... Понятно, что глуповатость Южного парка подходит для этой концепции, но и в этих рамках можно сделать много лучше. Основная претензия к монотонности происходящего - случайные вмешательства и забавные достижения быстро приедаются, и необходимость в 100й раз начинать снова ничем не оправдана.",-1,0
311560,Assassin's Creed Rogue,"Did you like AC 4: Black Flag? Well, I have good news for you: basically, this game is a improved version of BF.    A different perspective of the gameplay and storyline. You play as a Templar and it influences gameplay as well (for example, instead of assassination contracts, where you had to kill one target, there is assassination interceptions when you do the opposite, which feels really refreshing).    Instead of dull and boring Edward Kenway, we have Shay Cormac - harismatic and deep character that has more morality than his 'predecessor'.     Instead of mainstream caribbean, we have North Atlantic sea with it's icebergs and snowy forests. Love it.    Naval combat was also improved - Shay's ship has now mechanical gatling cannons and burning oil barrels.    Beautiful music.  Even though I enjoy this game a lot, I would reccomend buying it when it's -25% or more off the original price.",1,1

249650,Blackguards,"Turn based combat system? Yes please!  One thing I appreciate about the game is that so far I haven't encountered any battles that felt repetitive. The maps, the environments, interactive elements on the maps (starting fires ftw!), and the variety of opponents have kept it fresh so far. Of course I need to state that I'm only on Chapter 2 at this point, so maybe that changes. Some battles have been easy enough, others have been challenging. There's been a few battles that I've had to retry but it's been a fun challenge, not a drain on my enjoyment of the game.  So far, I'm loving this game and have been looking forward to playing it as time permits. I started over 6 hours into the game to switch from a basic character to an expert (custom) character. Having become more familiar with the game, I wanted to be able to customize my character more. I'm 20+ hours into this game and I'm still enjoying it which is a positive sign!",1,0

266510,Hand of Fate,"This game is one of the greatest I've ever played. That's not an easy thing for me to say. Everything about this game is unique. It gets a perfect score in my book. Also, it has the all time greatest boss fight at the end of the game, hands down. I love this game to death.  The gameplay is the best part of this game, the game can twist and turn any which way when your progress is lead by pure luck. The way the card system works is very simple and easy to wrap your mind around. The combat is excellent and fluid, it's awesome to watch. The combat isn't just hacking and slashing, it's about timing blocks and dodging opponents you can't fight all at once. The combat is reminscent to the first Fable, in fact, much of this game really is a Fable game without the brand name, but the combat is so much more interesting here than in any Fable.  The graphics are lush and colourful. It has that wonderful atmospheric fantasy mood that Fable set so perfectly.  The sound quality is top notch for the most part. There is a few times when the sound does cut out but a simple restart fixes that immediately. The soundtrack is awesome and really has an epic vibe to it. I was even thinking of buying it if it's sold on Steam. It's one of those soundtracks that'll take me back years from now. I love the clanging of the swords and the thumping of swords against shields. The voice actor behind the Dealer is on the same level of deep and mesmerizing as Morgan Freeman. He's like an English Morgan Freeman, I can't stress enough how good of a voice actor he is.  The story line is interesting, it's not a normal storyline. You enter at the end of the adventurer's story. This is a retelling of all his adventures. So it's a game about retrospective and reflection. The Dealer makes very interesting remarks and ponderings that make me think on a philosophical level. What kind of game does that?  I love a game that I can put hundreds and hundreds of hours into. A game that has endless replayability and isn't limited by just having a storyline. This is one of those games. It doesn't ever have to end. There's an endless mode. There's also 200+ cards to collect. Each card is an encounter. Every game randomizes these encounters and even throws in some that benefit you and some that debilitate you to a certain extent. This game definitely earns its pay and has lot of bang for very little buck.  If you're on the fence about getting it, don't be. This game isn't hard to fall in love with. I'd recommend this game to absolutely anyone. ",1,1
274230,RONIN,"I'll keep this short. I loved this game. It was enjoyable, despite some small control issues. You had to approach each room like a puzzle, but could be creative on how you use your skills. A few parts of the game were unintuitive, but even then they were beaten once you really took in your surroundings.  Then you make it to the final level. It's the steaming pile to cap off an otherwise good game. No checkpoints, enemies every two feet, and a unique mechanic that doesn't add much to the game, at least for me. I've looked around, and many people have begged the developer to add checkpoints, and that the final level destroys what was an otherwise enjoyable game, but those pleas have fallen on deaf ears.  It's a shame, because I liked the game, but the final level ruins the whole experience.",-1,0
284390,The Last Door - Collector's Edition,"So much better than I expected. The story keeps building and building. Really scary at times, thanks to brilliant sound production (just because the pixels are lo def doesn't mean the sound has to be!) and an amazing soundtrack that hits all the right notes, sometimes brooding, waxing to a climax, or even silent. The soundtrack uses strings as its backbone. It's pretty to listen too, and lends the affair a cinematic scope. Use headphones!! Fantastic story, very addictive with a lot of cliffhangers to keep you going. The puzzles are simple and won't bog you down, but are fun to uncover. Love this game &lt;3",1,0

The characters are all very likable; the sympathy the player feels for them amplifies this game's effective communication of the horror of the Great War and makes it conclusion all the more heartbreaking.",1,0

242700,Injustice: Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition,"If you like DC Comics and fighting games, this game is worth picking up. Comes with all DLC to date (and I'm pretty sure there isn't going to be anymore).  If you don't want to fight other people online, there is a full story mode to go through with a DC Comics quality story (which is to say, there is an alternate universe, so nothing really matters). There is also STAR Labs, which is similar to the challenge tower from Mortal Kombat (2011). However all the rewards that come from doing STAR Labs are automatically unlocked already in the Ultimate Edition, so there isn't a whole lot of point to play it, since it can become quite frustrating and doesn't really have much to do with the main fighting game.  The hype has died down for this game, but there are still people that play it both online and offline, but there seem to be issues with the online. The netcode is not good, by any means. It can be bearable, or it can be 5 seconds of input lag, followed by frame drops, followed by losing connection to your opponent. The game is no longer region locked, however playing against someone on the otherside of the world is not going to go very well.  The game has gone through some significant balance reworks, so a lot of characters are now viable, but the game is very zoner dominated, so if you prefer fighters that are all about getting in your opponents face, you should probably give Injustice a miss.  Overall, if you're already a fighting game enthusiast, you have no doubt played many games that are better than Injustice that you should stick to. But if you are new to fighting games, or just a DC fan, then Injustice is very worth picking up, combos are a lot easier to do than in other fighting games since they are less time restrictive. Blocking is simplified; hold back to standing block in one direction, hold down to crouching block in both directions. Forward and backward throws can be broken with the same button. All characters share some attack moves, such as uppercuts, sweeps and bounces. All characters have a character power, which is a gimmick that can be used to help you play that character better.",1,0

236390,War Thunder,"I have played this game since I was first introduced to it by jingles. (Jan, 5 2013) When i first started playing i was in love. It was the only thing I ever did all day. The thought of getting to jet drove me to play for 14 hours at a time. The game was great. Then the updates started to come... At first it was just harder to make money and xp. People hated it but I kind of liked it. Then the BR system came and balance left. Matchmaking had trouble getting fair matches but even that wasnt so bad. Then the russian bias got real. Im not one of those people that complain that I died to X russian plane/tank but after seeing russian tanks and planes survive things that would destroy any other tank it got annoying. (planes putting out fires, t-34s bouncing tiger 2 shots in the side, ext) But even this wasnt what made me quit this game. It's the company. They are absolutly terrible. Constantly censoring anyone with an opinion than dosent match theirs. They threaten to ruin RB if we dont let them attack youtubers that help them by finding cheaters? And even steam isn't safe. They constantly have people downvote any review that is negative. I can forgive russian bias. I can forgive the terrible BR system. I cannot forgive this company for the way they treat their community. To Anton Yudintsev, you made a game that was amazing. I loved it so much and always will.

298900,Space Hulk: Deathwing,"Rough round the edges, and poorly optimised (as of writing), the game is a bit difficult to recommend, but I'm recommending it regardless for the following reasons:    The game runs reasonable fine on 1440p for me, albeit slowdowns during lightning effects against hordes of enemies    Visually, the game is great, some of the lighting, shadows and volumetric fog is well done, and the player models 'look' and 'feel' like Warhammer 40k    The atmosphere is pretty well captured, it feels dark, grim, wondrous, scary    The voice work is good, it adds to the game's atmosphere    It plays well both on keyboard / mouse and controller (I almost prefer the latter in this game)   There are however a couple of things that won't make the game 'perfect' just yet:    The game is badly optimised in anything but 1080p    Finding relics only really help you with filling up the relics list in increasing your willpower marginally, but you cannot actually use them    Occasionally, tooltips, hints or key press indicators (around doors, relics or buttons) are missing, so just press 'use' on everything you see for now.    Obviously, I am not done with the game yet (only just finished chapter 2), but what I have played so far makes me want to play more and come back to it. I do hope that at least he performance issues are being resolved soon, as I would love to give the game a spin on 4k.",1,0

457860,Apollo 11 VR,"I saw this game on sale at a somewhat random occasion on the store, and was at first quite interested in the concept.  This, however, turned out to be a very underwhelming experience, and the first genuinely BAD vr experience I've had overall.  So let's start from the top, with a simple question: does this game deliver on its promises, ALL of its promises ?  The short answer is no. Now for the long answer.  Apollo 11 VR sells itself as 'a new type of documentary', but a documentary it is not. What it is, is a short, undercooked project with no genuine lasting impact, and very little short term fun or entertainment to be had. There is relatively little in the ways of information or factoids to be learned here, save for a fairly inelegant info dump in one of the later scenes. The 'mix of original archive audio and video' is used in a rather unpleasant way as well - rather than here to complement visuals and audio, it feels closer to a tacky attempt at simulating historical fidelity, and it gets old very quick.  Another issue comes in the form of very limited interaction. The store page mentions several critical sections of the game being interactive, and well, it isn't lying - you CAN take control of the command modules, the lunar lander and explore the moon's surface, but it is extremely limited. Perhaps the comparison is a bit harsh to make, but I expected from those sequences something akin to a simplified Kerbal Space Program, and it is in some aspects - but there is so little to do, in such small capacity, that one has to wonder if there even is a point to putting this here to begin with.  The issue of visual fidelity also needs to be addressed. Apollo 11 VR goes for the laziest, most basic direction possible in terms of graphics, and persists on being just kind of mediocre graphically. It doesn't take a lot of trickery to make even average assets on an accessible engine look stunning and this application tries to utilize none of them, which is made worse by the fairly immersion breaking oddities one may come across, such as spinning lense flares or the lifeless eyes of the few human models one gets to see.  The most drastic problem that overarchs all of those is that Apollo 11 VR feels uninspired, flat and basic - more than a shame considering it is set out to pay tribute to one of mankind's most significant accomplishements of the last century. This won't make you love NASA or space faring or the inventivity of man. If you already love those things, it won't give you a new perspective on them - in fact, if you're into building space shuttles and sending them out into space, you're better off playing Kerbal Space Program, which has practically everything game offers sans the overdone 'inspirational music' and without pretending to be historically accurate about anything.  One last problem about the game, as a VR title: it can be potentially very nauseating for some people. I have the huge advantage of not suffering from any motion sickness in VR, but those few scenes and panning shots of the moon or of planet earth can be extremely dizzying, and I can imagine that people who are more sensitive to the effects of motion sickness would not be able to get through these sequences without taking off the headset. A particular early sequence in which the player is set through a fly-by shot of the shuttle prepped for take-off is very uncomfortable, but doesn't really offer any of the thrill that one may expect from literally flying around a shuttle the height of a downtown appartment building.  As for longevity, well, I don't think it's quite as important as some may expect from a game like this that tries to be more of a set experience than something you'd go back to, but it struggles to reach 60 minutes. I hopped around the surface of the moon for as long as I could take it before getting bored at the complete absence of activites (don't trust the whole 'deploy experiments' thing, there is no moving of parts or assembly required, just one press of a button and models magically pop up), and still couldn't get to make this last more than an hour.  It could have been a lot longer, and a lot better, if more creativity had been employed in the making of the interactive segments, which in themselves should have been more numerous. Not to be an ideas guy, but I expected a lot more from it - I've got a set of controllers that allow me to grab several things at once, twist them around and whatnot, so I expected the devs to do what plenty of other games do and let me take the whole shuttle apart to see how it's build, or let me deploy those experiments by hand, or physically move the controls and push buttons inside of the shuttle, but there's none of that.  To finish this review, I'd simply like to reiter my earlier recommendation of KSP for those of you who wanted to pick this one up as a semi-simulator of sorts. If you just want a simple demo to show off VR, there's plenty more options that fit the function more than this one, a lot of which are FREE.",-1,0

351700,UnReal World,"I usually don't go in for this type of game. This market lost me to Wolfenstien 3D and wing commander fairly early on. Then several years ago, in a nastalgic period, I came across this game again. The dungeon themes were replaced with a more historic and reality based theme, It was far more fun than I remembered it being. Either something else came along or the dogs continuous barking made me stop playing again.  When the game released v3.19, my now grown son said 'Hey I found this game that you're gonna love'. I laughed when he told me, he had childhood memories of it. Since Sami offers it up for free, I'll give it a go again.  The dedication, helpfullness and great nature of the developer(s) of this game show not only in this new gem but in the community that rallies to support it.

24010,Train Simulator,"This is a very action-packed game, which involves you playing as one of the machine-spirits that reside in and guide our modern-day trains, as they undertake the perilous journeys to and from locations in the world, where half the threat is derailment and collisions, and the other half is being destroyed from within, by petty vandals and their vile ilk!  As expected, this is probably one of the most blood-pumping action games out there, where threats lie waiting at every corner, (and hell, even the corners themselves are threats, if you're going fast enough!) tugging and pulling at your desire to derail yourself, just for the pleasure of spiting the ungrateful commuters within your metallic frame, who probably didn't even pay for a ticket!

45740,Dead Rising 2,"Dead Rising 2 is the amazing sequel to the hit game for the Xbox 360 Dead Rising. you play as Chuck Greene, a motorcross sport champion who lost his wife in the vegas outbreak. He now comes to vortune city to compete in Terror is Reality to get money to get zombrex for his daughter Katey who was bitten by her mother during the vegas outbrake.   This game is visually stunning when considering the release date. It adds a lot of new features just like any good sequel should. jsut like the original Dead Rising it has a very interesting story that will have you hooked by the first cutscene. Just like the original Dead Rising, it ahs multiple endings providing the player with lots of replayability. the difficulty increases as you progress through the game to ballence it out as you get powerfull the more you level up by getting pp (Player Points)  The characters are fleshed out and the story is thought out. You have a reason for everything you do (well almost). you get attatched to these characters jsut like you should with a good game.   There is still that classic Dead Rising random element that you can do. such as using a bench to kill a zombie while wearing a mankini. this fun random element is one of the many reasons that Dead Rising was as popular as it was when it was first released.  The combat is still great with very few bugs/glitches. It makes things fun but sometimes challenging which gives a great contrast depending on your mood.  Overall, Dead Rising 2 has stood the test of time and is still so much fun to play and I definitaly recommend it to everyone! I rate it 8.7/10",1,1

There is a constant stream of decisions to make, and you also have to decide which skills to level up and when. So there is a lot more choice here than in a typical visual novel. It sort of feels like a choose your own adventure game with RPG elements added in. It's actually quite challenging, and you'll feel proud when you get an ending screen that doesn't involve Elodie dying some ridiculous death you could have never foreseen (they are almost all hilarious, by the way).  It's a fairly short game but it offers an insane amount of replayability. Almost everything you do (or don't do) comes back to haunt you later.

301860,Submerged,"An extremely mellow short film of a game, Submerged is by no means a bad game, but it outstays its welcome and completely fails to justify its $20 pricetag.  While I did purchase it for sale at $5, which I think is a significantly more reasonable asking price for what it is, it doesn't change the fact that the game is about 4-5 hours long and has enough story for maybe half that. Its pictographic record of what happened to the city and what led you there is fairly redundant, which I suspect was so you could piece together a reasonably clear picture without going out of your way to collect all the secrets, but it's most apparent that the game doesn't have that much to say when halfway through your flashbacks between missions change from an explanation of the past to literally just recapping the opening cutscene and the game itself.  Gameplay-wise, Submerged is just another Ubisoft-style sandbox hidden behind a mellow, mysterious atmosphere that brings to mind Shadow of the Colossus if you took out all the fights with colossi. Find a waypoint, climb to the waypoint, repeat until win. Calling the climbing mechanics parkour would be inaccurate to say the least - there's no skill challenge involved, no possibility of failure and no room for intuitive thinking. You can only climb on specific sorts of ledges, even when there are easy shortcuts clearly within the realm of your character's physical abilities.  All in all it works, especially since the main draw of the game is the relaxed atmosphere, but it's just not enough to justify its purchase or the time needed to play through it.",-1,0

332200,Axiom Verge,"An excellent Metroid clone, this one gets almost everything right. I think the general creepiness of the world feels like the original Metroid, but the controls are more precise like the SNES iteration. I love that the game never tells you exactly where to go next, this is what's missing in today's action/adventure games (with the notable exception of the Dark Souls series).  The upgrades that allow you to progress from one area to the next constantly surprised me - I was almost always wrong about what was needed to access a new location. A few examples: you don't need missiles to open doors, you don't use bombs to blow up weak blocks, you don't roll up into a ball to get through tight spaces, and you don't get a freeze gun to turn enemies into stepping stones. There were a couple exceptions, but for the most part the developer did an excellent job coming up with new ways to solve these old puzzles.  The music is some of the best I've heard in gaming, from any time period - dark synths with the occasional bit of creepy chanting. And the graphics, while a little bland in some of the wall/floor textures and enemy sprite designs, more than make up for any shortcomings with several rooms that are absolutely jaw-dropping. Many of the weapons also put on a nice light show, and are worth tracking down for this alone.  Speaking of weapons, most of them are completely optional, and unless you go back and thoroughly explore you won't find half of them. You probably also won't find many of the other secrets the game has to offer - I already know I didn't get the best ending, but I'm looking forward to going back in the near future.  If I had to come up with a complaint, I would say the bosses, while looking very impressive, all had fairly easy patterns that did not really change during the battles (most simply got faster as you damaged them). This is a minor issue though, and did not affect my enjoyment of the game much.  If you enjoy Metroidvanias, this one has my highest recommendation.",1,0

281990,Stellaris,"1st playthrough- Go as UN Humans. Ran out of influence. Unable to contract leaders and such. No biggie, but troublesome. It was the first time and was tring to get a feel for the game. Gave up when influence got to a consistent loss of -14.  2nd playthrough-UN Humans again. Game went on a little longer but ran out of influence again. Game doesnt really explain how this works so checked online to learn for a future playthrough and kept on. Realized that making ships auto update was actually lowering their combat scores significantly, some fleets went from 10k to 6k. Will manually update them in future playthrough, for now i'll ignore it. Rebelious factions ended up completely splitting my empire in several others. Even my home planet was gone. Checked online on how to avoid this. My species was the weakest of all, it was time for next playthrough.  3rd playthrough- Create custom race. The C'thuns, chilldren of Cthulhu are born. Militaristic race. Specialize in psyonics and warfare.  Conquered 3 other empires, liberated several species. The Chaotic fairness of Cthulhu was unstopable. No unhappy factions. Most other races idolised mine. Created several protection pacts to aid in political relationships. This allowed to eventually fully explore galaxy, only to realize you can't find all the ancient race artifacts. This mission progress was stuck at 4/6. Literaly all systems scanned. Whatever. Maxed out influence. Constantly maxing out minerals and energy. Ended up wining some wars probably because the enemy empire had no more resources to spend. Conquered 25%-35% of the O-shaped galaxy, manually updating ship classes was working great, but something was a bit off. I couldnt figure out the best ship fit for any given situation and the internet only provides information on the amount of tears people have because the ships are unbalanced. Whatever.  Our Empire's worst enemy? The United Nations of Earth. Literaly one of the most overwhelming federations, had about 50% of the galaxy for themselfs and had friends all around. If I went in with a 20k fleet they would come with 3 50k fleets. Fallen Conquerors Empire awakens, my grumpy northen neighbor. Instantly accept vassalization as I have no way to fight back such power. No problem for the C'thuns, we can acknowlegend superior races, for now. Realize most of my political relations are now locked. I can trade, so no big ussle, but the era of the conquering C'thuns was over. It was time to prepare for revolution. Invest all into research. Build more research ships to assist planets. Convert some planet facilities to labs, while avoiding negative balaces. Other races would attack here and there, no problem. Big daddy Fallen Empire would come to help and the mighty C'thuns could hold their own, eventually our enemies would be conquered by the fallen. A ton of years pass. About 500 maybe. Still not strong enough, but it was a matter of time.  Big Daddy Not-So-Much-Fallen Empire wages war agaisnt one of my protected friends. Fellow empire started it, actually. Realize I can't break the protection pact with them, as being vassal to another empire locks this options. Stuck in war with my big daddy for an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can't shoo away. Realize that since Im a vassal, protected empire is also red to me. Wtf? I am now being attacked by my protectorate, and by The Fallen. Why? I'm not even in the middle of them, but after watching all my space stations explode, eventually the time comes for surrender. The 'friendly' empire and The Fallen are the ones dictacting the terms, I have all options locked, since im not neither the main attacker nor defendant. 50% of MY planets go to The Fallen, because they won the war. I can only watch on this decision making.  This last paragraph went on a loop, eventually losing the game because the Mighty C'thuns are conquered with wars they have no option but to wage, againts all the other parties involved and eventually they decide to surrender with my planets on stake. I can't remove or atribute protection promisses, so I was completely locked on this one.  I can't really give a good review to a game that, however it much feels spetacular with details beyond other similar games, with really having much fun in working on all the possibilities and strategies, after a while it ends up reveiling it is a very unbalanced game with glitches and game breaking bugs, leaving a taste of unfinished game in your mouth.",-1,0

258520,The Vanishing of Ethan Carter,"If you know you have the patience for a game about exploring and solving puzzles slowly, then go for it. It’s the best looking game, and the way it tells the story is inventive.  Only the audio has glaring faults. Like they didn’t fence off the sound zones properly. Sometimes sound and music will stop at the edges of the map. Near buildings it’ll sound as if you’re inside, even though you’re not. And similarly when you’re inside it can sound as if you’re outside when you step near certain walls. The script and acting can sometimes also sound just a bit off. Like it needed another pass in editing, and another take in the recording booth. Also in the end credits they only have music for half the credit roll, so you end up staring at scrolling names in dead silence. There’s just a layer of polish missing on the sound front.  Apart from that it does what it sets out to do very well. Some of the puzzles require you to use your brain, and feel fun to solve. Others are the 3d equivalent to pixel hunting, but take place within clearly defined borders so you don’t go crazy searching for the clues. And boy does it look good. Might be worth it for that alone. Most importantly though the story has a good payoff. It’s a mystery with supernatural elements, and those often tend to fall flat in the end when the veil is lifted. This doesn’t.",1,0

It has a fun premise, a fascinating plot that keeps you involed (I would have been willing to keep going for several hours), and a nicely detailed artstyle that really give a sense of cluttured personality. I strongly beleive that the next game they make is full length though, or the players who aren't really really psychoticly into walking simulators will lose interest, but it serves its purpose: get people interested and spread the word about us. Reviewers who get borderline furious about this are getting way too upset over this short little teaser that at no point made any grand claims; all the hype i saw was from peple who played it and liked this experience and were able to aknowledge that developers can't 'rip off' something they already co-designed. I have a feeling most of the ill will towards this game comes from people who just don't like Simon Amstell or his work. Get over it, guys, we're all going to die. On the whole, I'm excited to see more, and I look forward to seeing what's coming next from these guys.",1,0

238010,Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut,"Deus Ex Human Revolution is a brilliant yet flawed game. A game that I love for a multitude of reasons. But as per usual, I want to quickly place a little disclaimer for those planning to buy this game with a LOW-END PC. You'll be able to run this game perfectly well with no issues. Maybe 720p or hell, native resolutions. My old laptop didn't pass the minimum requirements (it had a 1.8GHz Dual Core CPU) and it ran the game with 30FPS at it's native resolution (1366x768) with minor slowdowns at times.  But the game is well optimized and not really a bother in that department so don't worry about that.   Now. Let's get into the meat of this review.  Deus Ex Human Revolution is the prequel to 2000's Deus Ex. There were no other sequels (Don't mention the Fall or Invisible War, they don't count in my book) and it plays out the story of Adam Jensen. A former SWAT member that got ''kicked'' out of the team for taking part in the Mexican Town Massacre. This leads to Adam becoming the head of Security at Sarif Industries. Recommended to David Sarif by his ex-girlfriend, Megan Reed. I'm not going to spoil much of the story as the game's story is a brilliantly crafted experience.     The gameplay    It works and is easier to understand than 2000's Deus Ex in my opinion, but then again, I'm an idiot and took me a while to understand Deus Ex (2000)'s UI. The gameplay has been a bit simplified but the enemy AI is quite dumb at times but are accurate. There is infact Health Regeneration (which is meh in my opinion when it is done wrong which means that you're basically immortal), but it only heals you after a battle so you don't worry about running around looking for Medpacks, but that means that Devs can skimp over the level and not have to bother with Health Packs. The gameplay let's you do the usual ''Play it your way'' that most Stealth games let you. I'm calling this a stealth game as the game rewards you more for stealth rather than the original rewarding you equally for any sort of playstyle. The controls feel quite fluid in my opinion as it worked well. At first it was a bit awkward but then it became easier for me to play and was easier to see why they chose the default keymappings as they were. I also recommend having a 5-button (or more buttons) mouse due to the fact that the Augs themselves are mapped to F1-F4 like the original, but at times, it's easier to just press a sidebutton on your mouse to activate the Stealth Cloak Augmentation or the Smart Vision Augmentation.    The Audio    The OST itself is a brilliant one with tracks that consistently fit the mood of the area or situation you're in. The main menu track itself is a beautiful one that brings joy to me each time I boot up the game.  The opening theme itself, named ''Icarus'' is amazing to listen to in both in game and outside the game. Either way: The OST is lovely and awesome. That's always a plus in my opinion.     Enviroments and Levels    The game will often recycle areas but for reasons within the story, you'll go to Detroit and Hengsha twice. But that doesn't mean that the game is just being cheap and making it seem awkward. It's just reusing the same areas but with some sort of reasoning within the story and has some new areas to explore or new side missions to play around with, or even a new bunch of characters or existing characters that have new interactions with for your past actions. The enviroments seem realistic and yet futuristic. Most areas have atleast two or three ways of traversing around or fighting your enemies. The thing I hate about the areas and gameplay is that you can camp in the vents and just pick off the enemies one by one which makes it a giant camp fest if you're not bothered to try thinking to defeeat your enemies.   Well, in my personal opinion, you should most definitely play this title for all the positives. And the Boss Battles are reimagined so they're not giant turds like they were in the original version of this game.. BUT this game has more glitches. (none that I encountered but some others have)",1,0
284180,Magicians & Looters,"A very, very fun to play Metroidvania, with lots to like:  + Three different characters, each with their own abilities and items. + Lots of hidden items. + Many different zones and monsters. + Great sense of humour (do not turn on abridged mode! :D). + Wonderful soundtrack. + Difficult, but not too difficult.   + You can throw fruits at enemies!    The art style looked a bit weird at first, but after a little while it started to grow on me, and it fits perfectly with the rest of the game.

At first I was very reluctant to give this story a go, but I went through the darkness and 'won'.

Various scents, lures, blinds, and more are available to help you in your hunt, as well as an array of various weapon types from Rifles to Crossbows, designed to let you make your simulated hunting experience unique to your style.   I have played hunting simulators in the past and this one ranks up top with the better ones, for its realistic feel and approach. The landscapes are varied and immersive, the ambient noises are a nice touch and the graphics, while not great, aren't so bad you can't enjoy the game.

In true roguelike fashion, the game features perma-death: if you die, that's it - start again from floor 1! No second chances! You'll have to make do with a different dungeon and a different set of items on your next run!

When it comes to gameplay a few new modes are avaible, such as body count, which I thought was fun.

The gameplay itself is considered to be flawed by some, as the results of having the same setup may vary. However, just as the cats and rats symbolise our internal struggles, this seemingly random reaction at times of what should be systematic results is actually really only there to symbolise the following thing: that in life, even with the proper formula, you need luck and patience. This game is so deep, it has made me onder about several philosophical questions. I love the graphics, they are very colorful, sharp, I almost daresay sexy, and they make me happy and cheerful. The soundtrack is amazing, and I think it compares to Hotline Miami in terms of quality. In short: Gameplay: 5 Stars, Graphics: 5 Stars, Music: 5 stars. Truly an amazing game.

12750,GRID,"TL;DR - Fantastic game, great gameplay and AI, but can be a major pain in the glutaeus when using a keyboard  GRID is a diverse motorsport/racing game. While the graphics aren't that spectacular, the gameplay is well worth the price. This game has been overlooked by many who play Forza and Gran Turismo, but GRID surpasses the previous two in many respects.  Gameplay: The gameplay is solid. The physics are fairly realistic, the vehicles behave like you would expect, and the AI is much more natural than other games. They often quarrel among themselves, sometimes getting into large accidents and spinning off the track. The 24 Hours of Le Mans is a fantastic race, and I'm surprised not many other games contain it. The game plays fantastically on a controller, but is a major pain in the glutaeus if you have only a keyboard. I haven't been able to test out a steering wheel yet, but I heard it plays even better than a controller. The damage system is well implemented. Hitting a wall at an angle will damage your wheel, suspension, steering, possibly the engine, depending on your speed. With a damaged steering, your car will pull to the side, sometimes to the point where you have to quit the race.  Vehicles: GRID has a large selection of vehicles to choose from. Between tail-happy classic muscle cars, Touring cars, high-performance supercars, purpose-built drift machines, and many other categories, there is a car for every type of racer.  Tracks: I haven't gotten extremely far into the game yet, but of what I've seen, the track selection is fairly large. You have Yokohama, the Le Mans circuit, Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, a track in san Fransisco, a Michigan demolition derby track, and a host of other tracks.  Race types: Good variety in GRID. Your average circuits are to be expected, but GRID also includes downhill drifting, freestyle drift, touge/midnight touge racing, demolition derbies, open-wheel racing, GT championships, and my favorite of all, the 24 Hours of Le Mans.  Graphics: I haven't been able to test it fully, since my computer is as advanced as a toaster, but the graphics in full are nothing too special by default, but if you modify one of the files, you can enable much better graphics.  Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone wanting a different racing game and has a computer more advanced than a 2006 toaster.",1,0

402020,The Park,For a game that is meant to scare you this game failed to do so with me. And I am a really easily scared guy. It felt like they where constantly holding back on moments I knew if they did something I would scream out. So much lost potential.  And the audio in a game like this is really important. It is good but if they had used binarual adio it would have elevated the experience 10 times.   If this game get's VR support then it could be a fun thing to play trough. And I would do it again then. But as of now I cant recomend this game.  Better luck next time Funcom.,-1,0

But really you'll be hard pressed to find a bigger bang for your buck on Steam. The levels are very large and give you lots of options to complete missions within the parameters you need to work with.

First I started to play on my laptop with my ps3 controller connected, but then I had to plug my laptop to my TV because there was just so much beautiful to see, the colours, the creatures and just the whole aura with the game.

Its Music track is great as it keeps getting gradually better. Control scheme a bit weird turning from Zelda: link to the past swing sword kill to Turned based combat to something you would see in diablo. Its funny but if it was a bit more consistint it would be better.

204300,Awesomenauts,"I'm writing this review from a long time Dota player's perspective. The similarities are few, but the differences are so welcome. I would hesistate to call it a sped up condensed version of Dota, purely because it's 2d. This takes away so many things that the whole experience is different.   Games are handled much more casually, with players being able to drop in and out of matches. There is a level system external to the gameplay which unlocks the first 20 characters each level, and from then onwards unlocks a new skill option, one per level. You will gain one level per match, at least, and if you win probably 2/3 levels. Overall I found I had earned more things from levels than I was able to keep up with, which is a good thing.   The characters are fast to learn and there is not a lot of clutter on screen. The simplicity of some moves can sometimes be annoying, especially when you get dunked several times over by the same combo, but you eventually learn the pattern and solve the problem, much like bloodseeker's rupture. I will say now that the artstyle is great, and the game intro is super ♥♥♥♥ing cool. Also each character has a theme song that plays during your skill selection, pretty nifty.   The levelling system for your character within the match rewards good play and there is almost no (noticable) rubberbanding. Teamplay and foresight are key, being outnumbered is usually lethal. The respawn time is about the same as Dota's, but for the last 10 seconds you get to play a mini game to collect gold before you spawn, although it's not really necessary.   My main criticism is probably that out of the 20ish characters there are 3 that, at the moment, are only available if you pay. And those characters are hard to learn, because you can't use their skills thus can't get a feel for them. I haven't dabbled in any of the cosmetics, but it's worth mentioning there's no pay to play aspects other than purchasing the extra characters.    Overall, as a dota afficionado, I would recommend this game. It captures the frenzy and a small amount of the strategy of dota, without being anywhere near as time consuming or mentally demanding. No real criticisms, it's very well executed and cuts to the chase.",1,0
265930,Goat Simulator,"The game if fun for a few hours and then it gets REALLY boring. but of course I bought it when it was $13, not $10, so maybe i'm just bitter about that, but it would be definitley worth five dollars and the DLC's were free.

I find myself being connected to the other player on a different level, since everything depends on total co-operation, and because you always have to be close to eachother, or you die. And the way the game looks is really charming in it's own kind of way!  I recommend this game to anyone out there that needs something to play locally, since you can beat it in a single session. I also joined a couple buddies to play through this game at Gigacon 2014, and i had a lot of time to observe it. We beat it in a single sitting, for about 3-4 hours, and we had an absolute blast.

For all you Eye Cybermancy gamers and Killing Floor zerkers this might be right up your ally, it sure is for me. I love this game, the visuals are fantastic, the gameplay is smooth, fast, relentless and quite tricky when it comes to the large number of secrets hidden throughout the game. The game has good humour, over the top gore, and personally, I think this game is fantastic on PC. Max out the settings and you're good to go for hours of merciless mouse torture. Shadow Warrior does what it should do, it's an ode to the authentic shooter genre like we've known it from Duke Nukem, Serious Sam or the original Shadow Warrior.

244160,Homeworld Remastered Collection,"Homeworld is, hands down, one of the best RTS games of all time. Not only are the gameplay mechanics amazing, but it possesses one of the best narratives in the genre. The story is emotional and moving -- but without the forced melodrama you'd find in some other games. It's a straightforward tale told with sincerity.  The classic version of both games play like the original release, so check them out for the original experience.   The Remastered Editions enhance the graphics... but they also rebalance gameplay mechanics. This is most apparent in Homeworld 1. Strike craft are rendered all but useless, forcing you to use corvettes as your 'fighter wings.' You also no longer have to refuel them. Frigates and capital ships have been variously nerfed or overpowered. So, if you're a veteran of the series, your 'old school' tactics may no longer work. These changes angered some people, though I actually appreciated having a new twist on an old classic. It made the gameplay feel fresh, even though I've beaten the original version a dozen times.  So, whether you're a new player or a veteran returning home, there's something for everybody. Want the original experience? Play the classic editions. Want a new twist? Play the remastered editions. Either way, Homeworld is still one of the best strategy games ever produced.",1,0

115800,Owlboy,"On the surface, this is a fun little platformer game with aspects of twin-stick shooter. Like others have remarked, it has impressive art design. Unlike others, I didn't find myself very compelled by the story and overall game design. Does it have a message? Yes, you can definitely see the parallels it draws between its characters and the hardships that we, as inhabitants of earth, face economically, environmentally and socially.  But, was it fun? Kind of. Will it leave a lasting impression on me? Probably not. Is it worth the $20+US? No...I would say about $15 relative to other games I've played that are similar indie platformers.   I understand this was an indie title that took 9 years in the making - don't really understand why so long - possibly finances? In all honesty, I've played other indie games that were far more enjoyable to play and left a lasting impression - I'm talking about you Environmental Station Alpha, Cave Story and Valdis Story. Opposed to these others, I can't honestly say that I'd come back to play this one. It's very linear. Controls are just ok. There's a section near the end that requires some experimentation with platform jumping. I'll give a hint...if you've been using the analog stick in the flying portions preceding this, you definitely want to switch to the D-Pad during said jumping section near end of game. Something weird convolutes the analog left movement stick with the jumping mechanism, intermittently wonking out and prompting premature flight, loss of hang-time, etc. You'll see. Maybe the devs will fix this.  Anyway, bottom line, it is a fairly enjoyable game that I would recommend...with one caveat. If you don't mind spending the $20+, go ahead and purchase; otherwise, wait for a sale at around $15 or so.",1,0

275390,Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition,"*I'm evolving this review over time  While the game has a few more minor things that could use improving, the overall construction of the game is well though out and well executed.   + The music complements the theme and pace of the gameplay nicely and has a enough variety for the size of the game. It's also good, well composed music to boot + Solid animations and sounds that make you feel every hit you give/take  + Great visuals. Has real attention to detail with the Mexican art style and borrows a little from GRim Fandango, while remaining its own style + Level design is excellent and Guacamelee STCE should be used as a showcase for great level design to anyone aspiring to build platformers. Each new mechanic is introduced to the player beautifully, then combined with other previously learned mechanics, which provides a progressively tougher environment to fight through. There is also an almost perfect mix of player versus environment and player versus AI and this also gets more challenging at a good pace throughout the game  + Fast paced combat + Funny + Seeds other game art and pop culture art into the game with it's own style e.g.    Manny Calavera skulls can be found on posters throughout the game    + Cool game mechanics with things like    INTENSO (my favourite thing in the game and what an awesome name for it too!), Dimensional Shifting, Playing as a Chicken, etc.    + Moddable +   Has the land of the dead!   + RPG mechanic is well executed + LOTS of save points that are very well spaced out     - Mini map needs level detail, not just room shape - No quest log for side quests or clues on where to go to finish these - Enemies can interrupt special moves - Knockback is more frustrating than it needs to be. You get knocked back too far and it takes too long to recover, which really breaks game flow - If you die, you have to re-open all treasure chests you opened before dying after last savepoint. This is a minor one, but I feel it breaks game flow a bit - There need to be more teleportation spots in the game. When revisiting areas to get the extras with new skills, not being able to teleport to the next area without having to traverse a huge amount of ground, becomes very tedious   - Controls while feeling fairly solid, could be better - The stick controls could handle player intention a bit better e.g. if player is pushing the left stick predominantly up but not perfectly, then the game should still take it as up, not sideways - If you fight a boss and die, when you respawn your intenso meter doesn't return to the fullness level it had before the fight - Throws often don't go where the arrow is pointing - Pushing off a wall for Goat Fly often ends up with Juan just dropping off the wall - Platform clipping is unforgiving and it gets annoying fast when you're jumping around on floating platforms  - Double jump doesnt work if you jump from holding onto a wall - The throwing mechanic is broken. Objects will often not be thrown in the direction of the arrow and this is infinitely frustrating during sequences in the game where this is necessary to move on to the next bit - Intenso meter doesn't return to original state of fullness when you respawn if you die in a boss battle   +- I'm in 2 minds about the wall jumping mechanic in the game. It's one of the biggest, if not the biggest mechanic in the game and the levels are clearly designed to take full advantage of it works with jumping from wall to wall and not being able to jump up the same wall in consecutive jumps. While this presents the player with a challenging mechanic, it's also very frustrating to use while traversing areas because it leaves no room for recovery from slight mistakes. This is really evident in the beginning of the game before Juan gets his dash skills.  Personally, I would have made the early design decision to go with a consecutive wall jump up the same wall and used a limiter like jump stamina. This way, most of the challenges would still work and the level design wouldn't need to be any more involved for developers to prevent player out of bounds issues.",1,0
305010,Toxic Bunny HD,"I could not find a single thing I liked about this game. The intro sequence runs at 15 FPS despite being an FMV, the default controls are godawful, the character controls extremely poorly even after you modify the controls to make sense, the art style is off-putting, the dialogue is painfully bad, the music is bland and uninspired at best and grating at worst (it is not possible to listen to the main menu music for any length of time),  But what made me stop playing was the tutorial. The game doesn't tell you what buttons to press to do anything and doesn't let you look at the controls unless you exit to the main menu,  if  any of the buttons work at all  which they didn't my first time playing ; I had to exit to the main menu and open the tutorial agan before the game arbitrarily decided to let me  use the movement keys . Not to mention that it was extremely easy to render the tutorial outright  unwinnable  if you didn't know what controls did what; I ran into this  twice , first when I killed the first enemy from a distance instead of walking inside his hitbox and using an item that killed both of us, second when I got to the shop and bought the first thing I was allowed to buy, only to find out that I was supposed to buy something else which was more expensive and now I didn't have enough money for it.

The whole point of the game is to find a way to die on each level by solving platforming puzzles, except the few where you need to stay alive, which is cool, but the levels can be long and hard. With no check point system and kind of sloppy controls, I ended up getting stuck towards the end of the levels where I needed to die or dying on the levels where I didn't need to die far too often and ended up having to restart over and over again.

245170,Skullgirls 2nd Encore,"Skullgirls is a critically loved indipendent fighting game Made by Reverge Labs  Mechanics are very well done and familar to other fighting games but does it with style. Being team based also but you can still go classic one on one. if you do a handicap like 1 on 3 the alone fight will be abit more tough to have more balance. Its does a great job introducing you to the game and how it plays also with some characters that play great also and has a good varity on the types of fighters. Each character has a story mode with stylish pictures and text for when the characters talk but from what I know the cutscenes are only voice on playstation consoles. The interactions between the all the characters are great but some of the stories arn't the greatest writing even though like most fighting games including this the good writing comes from the characters backstory and how they act when i said some of the indivual stories arn't the greatest writing i dont mean the writing is bad some of the indivdual stories are good even. The world is very interesting also and the charcters do have great backstories. The graphics and art are fantastic and looks like it had a bunch of creativity and effort put into it. The characters look like they were drawn with alot of detail with great structure, lines, lighting and shadows on the character and the stage. The characters move smoothly and really fast in fight abunch of movement and frames while still manageing to keep its look. A really fantastic 2d traditional fighting game with fun characters. And one of my favorites",1,0

203770,Crusader Kings II,"Just from a glace at the reviews, you probably get a pretty good idea about what it's about. CKII is about managing political intrigue and your own personal royal family while maintaining a strong and united enough duchy/kingdom/empire to expand. A lot of the game is just a son-murdering and prisoner-ransoming simuator, and that's what makes this game so very unique in the grand strategy genre. This game just gets grand strategy so right.  I've already sunk a few dozens of hours in the game, and I've only scratched the surface. In my largest game, I've been able to reunite the kingdom of Ireland, take all of Wales and half of Scotland, but it all fell apart after my king died, my brother somehow became king of England under my nose, and took all my holdings in Scotland, and my son was a craven, arbitrary imbecile. Soon my country started revolting into various factions, and my back-stabbing brother decided to get into the mix and start declaring war on my now-isolated Wales, and it also turns out he got The Holy Roman Empire on his side, when my only ally was the king of Garcia in Spain, who was too busy murdering Muslims and having incestual relationships with his cousins. Needless to say, Ireland fell. Then I tried to be a republic (DLC). That failed pretty quickly, turns out when vassals hate you, they don't want to vote for you. Also, republics love war just as much as the Crusaders. Speaking of which, recently I've started again, this time as a Spanish king myself, and I've been having a totally different experience crusading against the southern Muslims, while having some nice inbred children of my own, while trying to deal with the fact that my sister has claims on all my lands. Most of my effort in that game has been devoted to murdering her as quickly and quietly as possible, but, unfortunately, a drunk co-conspirator was a little less serious about the whole 'quiet' part. Oh, and turns out, there is a lot of Muslims south of Spain, and some of my fellow Catholic rulers were a little less into the whole 'war' part of crusading.  Needless to say, there are a lot of dangers in Crusader Kings II. There is never a moment of complete peace, there's always somebody who wants you or your kids or your spouse dead, there's always an ally who's always nagging you to join his war, and there's someone getting some sort of terrible disease, there's always someone to throw in prison, always some vassals to please, and there's very often some sons or brothers you ought to kill off before they become the king of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ England. There is no end game crawl, and you'd be hard pressed to find another grand strategy game that pulls that off better than CKII.",1,0
257510,The Talos Principle,"The Talos Principle is a masterpiece.  Before I purchased this game, I expected it to be similar to Myst. The screenshots and the game description made me think this way. But The Talos Principle isn't like Myst at all. Instead, this game is quite similar to Portal. That's fine. I enjoyed both Myst and Portal very much. The only difference is that The Talos Principle is magnitudes better than Portal. It's simply THAT good.  At the time of this review, I've played this game for 42 hours. And I'm only about 80% done. Plus I have the DLC to look forward to. I bought The Talos Principle during a sale, but it's easily worth buying it even at full price.  Edit:  OK, I've now played this game for about 71 hours, and I've completed the entire base game plus the DLC. The Talos Principle really delivers on quality to the absolute end. If anything, the last 5-10 hours of the game were some of the most fun and intriguing.  Road To Gehenna is a really good DLC that adds new elements to the game. For example, the computer terminals are significantly more interactive, and the story is richer than in the original game. Plus, some of the puzzles in the DLC are geographically enormous, spanning hundreds of feet in all directions, including vertically. New characteristics like these are part of what makes Road To Gehenna seem much more like a sequel than a DLC. It's definitely worth buying.",1,1
227180,Kingdom Wars,"This is by far one of the games that you're looking for, if you're on real time strategy games, immersive gameplay also really fun to play, the first hours might be rough for some people, but you can enjoy everything about it, there are 3 races with plenty of strength and weakness (humans, elves and orcs, pretty nice people that always help you and they are fun to chat with, it's an awesome community, it's not a pay to win game... it's more like a learn to play and win game, you can't be bullied by people more powerful than you, they have a pretty balance pvp system, there's something here that you can't find in any other game and makes it great and kinda addictive, also pretty good moderators, i recommend this game, for new players and for veterans, because of the always challenging gameplay, build your village, establish an economy, build your army, rise an stronghold, siege cities, upgrade your armies, get dragons, tame/kill ogres, kill demn unicorns, burn orc villages, burn trents and their sacred elf woods, burn human cities, actually burn and kill everything that moves or not, and loot their bodies, because why not?, you won't regret it",1,0

I recommend this game to anyone who liked the Rebuild games or other turn-based games.

Great job on taking the browser game and making such a great sequel for it.",1,0

320300,Car Mechanic Simulator 2015,"Cons:   *Not many cars  *Most of the songs are what can only be described as 'electronic fart noises that 6 year old kids listen to while they play Minecraft.' A few songs are tolerable, but you'll probably want to play this game on mute to avoid the tasteless music and incessant phone-ringing.   *The auction system is a complete joke.  If you don't show interest in a car, the AI won't bid on it at all. If you so much as bid on a car once, the AI will spam it with bids until a car with a starting bid of $4,000 has well over $40,000 in bids. All exaggeration aside, the last car I bought started at around $20,000 and ended at over $60,000. At $500 per bid and a $40,0000 raise, that's 80 bids. 80. 'Come ONNNNNNN, JUST LET ME BUY THE CAR.' is something you'll probably say to yourself a lot.   *It's pretty repetitive. Unbolt this part, beat on it with a hammer until it breaks, buy a new one. You'll be running back and forth to your PC a lot, so I suggest that your first upgrade point goes to a tablet. It'll save you a lot of time and frustation.  *Did I mention that there aren't many cars? I think there are maybe 10 different ones. I also got the Fiat DLC for free, somehow, but I don't think everyone else will. Still, not nearly enough cars for this price point. The lack of variety really makes it even more repetitive than it already is.   *Not much driving going on. After you finish restoring your poorly-modeled, generic-looking knock off of a Peugeot 505, you might want to drive it. Your options are a small skidpad that was ripped off from Beam MG Drive, or the testing area.   *Poor car models. Looks more like CMS 2012, but I still can't run it at the highest settings on my PC with 6 GIGs of memory. Medium-high settings at around 30 FPS.   *The customer orders are tedius and more or less all the same. 'Loud exhaust, fix all driveline issues, repair all body panels.' Every time. Every single time. It's always the same problems with every car.   *You need 9,000 XP and $50,000 to unlock the garage and be able to auction and restore cars, which is probably the only thing in the game worth doing. It took me about 16 hours to get to that point, give or take. So it'll take roughly 16 hours to get to the point in the game where it'll be worth playing, but then you need to do more customer jobs to raise money to buy and repair cars, because buying the parking lot and other parts of the garage will eat up most of your money at the beginning of the game.   *Overpriced, along with the DLC. It would be a great game for $10, and $15 including the DLC.   *There's not really any simulation going on. Everything is too simplified and easy. Maybe I'm just not in the age group for the target demographic or something. There's a lot more to a car than 50 bolts and some body panels.   *So [loading] many [loading] loading screens. Why. How could this game possibly need this many loading screens? Need to scratch your nose? Loading screen. Go to the auction? 2 loading screens, and then 2 or 3 going back to your garage. And just for the fun of it, a loading screen to launch a loading screen. It's like being on Oprah when she decides that everyone wins a loading screen. 'YOU get a loading screen! YOU get a loading screen! EVERYBODY GETS A LOADING SCREEN!'   Pros:  *I guess it's pretty entertaining for a little while. While what little charm it had wore thin a long time ago, I still enjoy it. I honestly don't think my enjoyment of the game makes up for everything else. It's not good, and not bad. It's basically the definition of mediocre.   Edit: If you look at it as a car-based puzzle game, you'll be a little better off. As a car mechanic simulator, it's not that good. As a car-based puzzle game, you'll have a hard time finding something better. I don't have much of the DLC, but I'm sure with the cool cars they've added on it'll be even better. Not everyone will like this game, maybe even most people. I still like it. It's relaxing, though a bit tedius sometimes. You don't need to know much about cars at all to play it. Just pay attention to what parts need to be removed in what order and you'll be okay. Would I recommend this game? Probably not. It seems to have a pretty specific audience. That doesn't make it a bad game, but not everyone will find it enjoyable. And I feel like a small Eastern European game company who tries their best to make a good game deserves a good amount of support. Like others said, it seems pretty pointless that you can't customize your cars in the base game. Also, you get the parts from the DLC cars in your parts catalogue for the DLC cars, even if you don't have the DLC.",1,0

Even if you're not familiar with the original release from years back, you may recognize some of the characters if you have previously been into the M.U.G.E.N scene a lot. The most prominent character is probably the one most people would recognize; that of course being, Luna Himeki.. Pink hair, wields two guns and notorious for her interesting choice of undergarment.  If you're looking for a great 2D fighter game, there are much better games out there. Guilty Gear, Blazblue just to name a few (or if you like the female characters scene, Skullgirls). The fighting in this game is pretty decent really but in all honesty.. with the drawbacks of this game (few gamemodes, engine limits and no online play) the only thing going for it is the 'anime appeal' by which we all know implies to otaku culture. Whilst playing this game, I can't help but expect something 'bad' to happen to one of the characters at any given time.. but that may be a different problem I'm dealing with, oh well.

281220,BloodRayne: Betrayal (Legacy),"BloodRayne Betrayal is a game that doesn't really deserve a thumbs up or down, but something in between. The core gameplay is there and is fun, as are the graphics and sound. The game plays very similar to pre-SotN Castlevania, which is great.   The problems with the game boil down to the controls and difficulty, which are in some ways two sides of the same coin. The game is almost ruined by some of the downright unfair and cheap segments later in the game, which are made worse by the not-100%-responsive controls.   The story also leaves a lot to be desired. I wasn't necessarily expecting anything that great from this game in this regard, but it ends way too abruptly and I feel the game should have at least another four or five levels of content. It's like they cut off the last quarter of this game - final boss and all. The game is also laughably short, even for a 2D platformer (I beat it in three hours on my first try at the game). This could've also been fixed with a few more levels added.   Overall, this game is good, but leaves a lot to be desired. If you're just looking for something to play that reminds you of old school Castlevania, it's a thumbs up and you should try it. Anything else? Probably not so much. Maybe try it if you're bored and see it on sale.",1,0

The game also has quite a sense of humor. For example, when choosing a difficulty level, there's an option to confirm and cancel. When you put the cursor on Hard, the word cancel changes to 'I'm too scared!' There are other funny moments in the game itself, as well as some touching moments.

(I'd like to see complete random cars on track, that start in random positions of the circuit when you do a free practice for added realism!)   I got this game on early access (and spent most of my time on Monza until the Nurburgring made it's glorious appearance.)   So this review is ONLY based on a comparison for aforementioned track. I run a Crossfire R290 reference setup on a 32GB Asus ROG Tytan (i7-4970) so graphically, my setup should handle anything and everything I throw at it.   Assetto Corsa looks great, Project CARS looks a bit greater however the ForceFeedback on PCars is awful. AC on the other hand gets it spot on. Touch a rumble strip in AC, you rumble. Touch a rumble strip in PCars, nothing. (most of the time.)   PCars offers more in the way of variety and content (a lot more to be honest) but if I'm after a quick(ish) lap of my favourite track, I come back to AC. It's not quite as pretty but plays much better with a heightened sense of reality that I look for in a Sim.  ",1,0

303210,The Beginner's Guide,"What a strange game.   Perhaps it's a good sign that over the course of playing The Beginner's Guide, I developed multiple interpretations of what it's trying to say.   The Beginner's Guide is the story of two indie game developers and the relationship they share over the course of a dozen or so developed games. One developer walks you through the other's games, one at a time, explaining what he thinks each game is trying to 'convey.' They are all walking simulators, and at times, you get the pretentious cringe of trying too hard to feel meaningful.  My first major takeaway is that The Beginner's Guide exists to help you think about games differently. It is obviously *for* 'games as art.' Games that are less about gameplay and more about message. It's here to walk you through how to view these types of entertainment in a way that does not prioritize completion rates and collectibles and action. It's like an art teacher teaching you how to appreciate art.  But that is only one of the game's many messages. The Beginner's Guide has a lot to say about a lot of different things, and some of them may not even necessarily make sense to you. There's things in here that I suspect may only be relevant to other game developer types. About the sort of... mental needs you build up. The attachments to certain ideals you have.  I'm not entirely sure I understand all of what The Beginner's Guide is trying to communicate, but... well. It impacted me just the same, in ways I didn't even feel prepared for. The feelings this game conjured in me lasted for days.  Maybe that's mission accomplished.",1,0

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"If you like to blow ♥♥♥♥ up, kill hundreds of innocent people, get drunk all day long or use druggs all day long then this is the game for you.  Atm this is my most played game in my whole library, it might say that i have 111 hours on it but i played it for the most part when i had no connection so it didnt saved all my play time, if it would save then i ez had over 1400 hours game time on it..  As for the game you start of in a town called goodsprings in the mohave desert wich is somewhere near nevada in the period of 2182 where the whole world is ♥♥♥♥ed.. You wake up up in a motel at some doctor after you had been almost killed and dropped in a grave. Your mission is to go after the guy who did that and kill him while doing tons and tons of sidequests that gives you uniqe items such as weapons and armour. Sure the game is a bit older and still has loads of glitches and random crashes (yes even i crash sometime while i use a gtx 770).   However, the game is similar to skyrim but with its own amazing things such as making drugs or alcoholics on a campfire (yes such things are possible). If you played Fallout 3 and liked that game then you obviously want to get ur hands on new vegas to (fallout 3 was better though). When ur done trough out the story and most of the quests etc then head over to nexusmods and mod the ♥♥♥♥ out of your game so you can spend many more hours in it and get loads of extra items and even features such as other characters to play with (mad max/zombie/ghoul/dwayne johnson and even will smith).  I myself decided to start over again with a new character just to get certain achievements that i didnt get cus i had to hack my way around (doors that wont open etc).  The gameplay itself is smooth as ♥♥♥♥, like 95% of the weapons has 0 recoil and with V.A.T.S you can even kill your target way to ez..  Anyway, i recommend this game to everyone that likes an open world game where you can sink many hours on by doing tons of quests and killing tons of people/monsters.  I rate this game 10/10 as it is my most favorite game and one of the best all time games ever made.",1,0

43110,,"Criminally underrated, this is one of the most atmospheric and immersive FPSes I've ever played. Set in a severely devastated post-apocalyptic nuclear hell of a Russian wasteland, Metro 2033's stunning visuals do a great job transporting you into the dark depths of the underground subway station. Due to the level design and obsessive attention to detail, you can almost smell the choking odors of the metro's damp, dusty depths. I don't know if it's the deep mammalian part of my brain that's doing this but I felt almost suffocated during these segments, desperate for fresh air and a blue sky; things we take for granted in real life.  However, when you do get to the surface, things are hardly any better. A weak sun shines bleakly through a permanent radioactive fog, and the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Terrifying monsters, almost biblical in appearance, roam the wasteland. If humanity's home was once the surface, it certainly no longer is. It belongs to the demons now. If anything, Metro 2033 carries an undeniably strong anti nuclear war message that will be hard to forget. The feeling of hopelessness in the ruins of the world is so prevalent I found myself having to take a break from time to time. It's like a realistic Fallout without all the trademark Fallout silliness present to lighten the mood.   I only have a few gripes about this game, mostly about the human enemy A.I. You fight your fellow man during several encounters in the game (yes, even when the world is this effed up people still find reasons to kill one another) and you often have the option of stealthily tackling situations. However, the enemies behave erratically, sometimes they seem oblivious to the point of blindness to your presence, other times they spot you hiding in the dark behind a crate from a mile away and start sniping you with pinpoint accuracy. There's no 'caution' mode where the enemies have to investigate your last known position since they found a comrade with an arrow in his throat or whatever, they just instantly know where you are. This can be frustrating since ammunition is so scarce you'll likely want to avoid loud firefights if possible.  Ammo is so rare in this world that premium ammo is used as currency (as in 1 bullet for a piece of bread or something). There are also home made pneumatic weapons, that operate like deadly nerf guns which need to be pumped up between firing. The shooting and gun play feels impactful and desperate due to the scarcity of ammo. As you see your last bullets chugging away you'll find yourself running around hopping in fear with a mutant snapping on your heels. I've found myself resorting to using my knife a few times. Very stressful stuff.   The mutant A.I. works pretty well, possibly because a mindless monster charging at you is easier to program than ruthless, calculating Nazis. The sound design makes you jump at every clatter and scurry in the dark. I felt quite vulnerable as I scanned dilapidated rooms with a flickering flashlight. I actually found myself breathing a sigh of relief when I found my drunk Russian A.I. companions after a long periods of separation, which the game presents to you regularly. I normally find A.I. companions in video games annoying and pointless, but the atmosphere and tension in the dark depths is so oppressive and depressing that even A.I. badasses who speak like Borat are great to have by your side.   This game is definitely worth experiencing, I can't wait to play Metro: Last Light.",1,0

230230,Divinity: Original Sin (Classic),"A trip back to oldschool RPG worth every penny!  Divinity: original sin is very similar in style to the old RPGs in the forgotten realms series (Baldur's gate etc). But unlike those games the combat in this game is all turn-based. I found the story interesting and there is a lot of areas to explore in the game. There is a lot of dialogue in the game and you can speak to most if not every npc in the game (including animals if you have the skill for it), although most non-quest related npc's have the same dialogue options. Divinity:OS also has a lot of humor in it and it has a certain sillyness to it in some places, which i love about this game. Quest wise there is a good assortment of quests in the game, many of them linked to eachother in some ways. It didn't feel very linear to me, there are pure sidequests in the game just for extra loot, xp or extra story. Oh and there is no such thing as a waypoint marker on your map telling you exactly where to go and what to do which i found very refreshing. You have to rely mostly on reading notes and diarys and using your brain to progress further. At the same time, in some cases it can be a bit too much. One thing that stands out is the need to solve puzzles in a few areas that involves really tiny buttons hidden in the environment, sometimes requiring your character(s) to have points in perception to even make them appear. It's not a huge deal but it can be annoying when you get stuck for hours on one puzzle during the main story (one in particular made me stay up until 6AM pulling my hair out until i finally got through)   Combat in Divinity:OS is fairly standard turn-based combat and i must say, very challenging at times even on normal difficulty, i found it easier a bit into the game though as the characters grew in power. One nice addition that i really like is the ability to use the environment and the combination of elements (fire, water, air, earth) to create effects on the battlefield. Like for example electrifying a puddle of water with a lightning spell, stunning everyone standing in it (including any of your own characters standing in it) or setting of an explosion by throwing a fireball into a poisonus cloud.  This game also has a crafting system as well which i didn't use that much on my first run. It seems a bit hard to figure out what items you need to combine to make stuff in some cases unless you search the steam community or google. The system itself is fairly simple, just combine ingredients by dragging and dropping them onto eachother or to some tool in the environment (like a forge or an anvil), but you need to find books or papers describing what items to combine and even then, there are ingredients that can be added onto the end result of the craft to create new items that i didn't find a description for anywhere. I guess i'll have to dive deeper into this aspect of the game on my next playthrough.  Well, what more can i say? I loved the music, there is a great mix of moods, happy, sad, action and humor (a certain song played in taverns, a favorite). Graphics i won't go into that much, i enjoyed the level of detail in the game but it isn't next gen graphics, very minor issue imo. The other aspects of the game like story and gameplay is so much more important. Bugs then? I encountered one problem throughout the whole 50 or so hours of gameplay that seemed like a bug, getting stuck in a dialogue at one point. It was solved by restarting/reloading so nothing big. Other than that i had two crashes at the end of the game, after playing for about 18 hours straight!  All in all, i am very satisfied with this game, it was so much better than i expected it to be and it brought back that good feeling i had when i used to stay up for hours, immersed in games like Baldurs gate or Planescape:Torment. I really hope to see more Divinity games in the future or at least an expansion to this game. Thanks for making this wonderful game!",1,0

261030,The Walking Dead: Season Two,"Thoughts: I finally realized what was lacking in The Wolf Among Us that made it feel less like a game compared to Walking Dead Season One, and it's also lacking in Season Two: in Season One, there were a few sections where you had to explore and interact with a large open area in order to solve a puzzle or problem. This large exploration area not only gave some meat to the game, it also helped to flesh out the characters more as you could talk to them and catch up with them. This is pretty much lacking in Season Two: instead the game feels more like a series of cutscenes with dialogue options interspersed with QTE action sequences. There are some areas you can explore, but the areas are small, there's not much to interact with and the puzzle-solving element is minimal. The lack of this makes Season Two inferior to Season One, IMHO. All that said, it's still an enjoyable ride. Clementine is a fantastic character and I loved that there were several 'little girl' options for her dialogue, like hugging a person or giving them *sad eyes* to gain their sympathy. There were quite a few harrowing decisions to be made (although I have to say none as harrowing as in Season One), one QTE sequence in the first episode that is not for the faint of heart, some interesting and likeable (and a few utterly hateable!) characters, many horrible deaths, a few heartbreaking betrayals, and one dream sequence in the final episode that was an utter gut punch... Ultimately a fun roller coaster ride, but I wish Telltale would put the exploration and puzzle solving elements back in their games.",1,0
243470,Watch_Dogs,Great Idea for a game and would be amazing.....BUT.....it bit the dust again following the same issues that have killed AC each and every single time. I can play the game fine running around but once I get into a car and start driving off somewhere it gets super-choppy mostly when there is too much going on in a scene and unfortunately there is no way to control the population density which only makes that far worse. So because of this until it's fixed if it gets fixed that is (probably not) since it was always an issue with AC lagging out in high pop areas I'm giving this a BAD RATING and I WOULD NOT recommend it to anyone. You are better off without it or trying it through other means. So far this is pretty shoddy and definitely not worth the $60!,-1,0

This full-fledged game should be no surprise to those familiar with Lucas Pope’s work.The free versions found on his website are unique and explore seemingly simple ideas for a greater purpose. For example, the Republica Times game explores the complex notions of the power behind media, government corruption and political unrest. These same themes spread into Papers, Please, which makes it a very powerful experience. It helps to split the screen into an overall border watch view on top, which shows people standing in line, the person approaching the booth and the movements of the guards. It will also show terrorist attacks and where you will go when given the tools needed to sedate (or kill) people rushing the wall.

203160,Tomb Raider,"Who doesn't know Lara Croft in the gaming community? Every gamer has fantasized about her (of course, Angelina Jolie's portrayal helped a lot). Attempting to change something that looked established requires guts, and the guys at Crystal Dynamics have plenty of guts. This version of Tomb Raider is different to the ones we adventurers love. First of all, because it's a merge between several genres of gaming. Sure, you can define this game as being an adventure game, but it's also a shooter, an RPG, a platformer... heck, it even has some stealth in it too. And second, this is not the Lara Croft we know and love, despite the visual differences. This game works as a prequel to the adventurer. She presents herself as a survivor, and this is the primal task of this game: surviving, no matter the cost. The gameplay and dynamics of the game are impecable, the graphics are beautiful, the story is well written and the atmosphere overall is dark, spooky and often pessimist. This game does everything right, and you know it since the first minute you play it. This game is an experience every gamer should have in his life. There is only one negative aspect I can say about Tomb Raider: every time you alt-tab out (every single time), the game crashes to desktop when you attempt to go back to it, leaving no message at all. This can be annoying, but it doesn't jeopardize your progression too much, since the checkpoints are plenty and well placed.  Final score: 5/5. I truly loved this game.",1,0

401190,Dinosaur Hunt,"Let me make something clear.  If you've grown accustomed to the Cookie cutter Monopoly that is Call of Duty, Battlefield, and even the most recent power titan; OVerwatch.  This isn't the game for you.   There is an unrealistic amount of complexity in it's simplicity. An aged feeling of a young lad racing home from school with only one goal in mind- To play a great game.  I'll explain a few things that replicates the sensation of the game. As best I can, rather.   GRAPHICS -   Astounding. I, being a man of class, would like my outfits to match my tools. A black, lightly dusted cloth adorns both your character, his outfit, and his weapons- leaving only his facial features to differ. This is not a lax of developers. This is an ingenius method to keep you focused on the game. Enthralled. Entertained. Complex designs distract from what you came to do. Play.  GAMEPLAY -   I was able to fool a dinosuar into believing himself to be my comrade. After standing atop his mighty form- I charged boldly into battle. The other dinosaurs, assuming him to be a comrade of their own, refused to nip at my ankles. This is development at it's highest asset. Games like The Stomping Lands, Ark, etc simply can't compare in the level of complexity. A.I pathing is simply ingenius. I've seen multiple instances of enemies rushing past my partner to attack me instead. Now, one would assume that this was a feat of bad coding.  False.  The A.I actually factored in my superior aim, and priotitized me as a far more viable target. This made more sense to me. Don't target the weakest. Target the strongest. Take out the elite.   PVP -   The game has a randomly occurring PVP mode that is absolutely breathtaking. Often times, Enemies will stop spawning. Without rhyme or reason. In these episodes of peace and tranquility, you are damn near influenced into firing at one another to pass the time. What was already an overwhelmingly fun experience is now an outrageously in depth combat system waiting for exploitation. Killing a friend doesn't seem to cause a mission failure. Or being killed for that matter. Or death in general. This doesn't make the game *Easy*- it adds yet another complex layer to the game that deserves a spot in Valve's vault of greatest hits.   Overall -   Buy this game. Letting this opportunity pass by is insanity. When I purchase something, I usually grade a game on the hour to minute ratio. For each dollar spent, a game needs to entertain me for an hour. At 0.50$- I spent a whole hour plus playing. That's nearly 200% profit of fun. Words cannot explain the feeling of blasting the same two different dinosaurs for an entire hour straight. The only reason I stopped playing was because my house had caught aflame from the sheer heat this game gave off.  !0/10 Best game available.  IGN- 9/10 Gamespot 9/9 GAme Informer 4.8/5  This review is false.",1,1
281640,The Banner Saga 2,"Like the 1st game, BS2 is built upon a solid gameplay formula and fascinating worldsetting. Unfortunately, the execution falls apart. Stoic Studio behaves like that spiteful, arrogant artsy kid, bragging about the genius of their work but simultaneously mocks you for playing their game.  If you're new to the turn-base strategy genre, the game is going to feel utterly alienating. And Stoic really doens't bother to hold your hand. You're thrown into the thick of battle to fend yourselves. You're going to make mistakes and you're going to feel it. Not in a satisfying 'everytime I retry I get a little better' kind of way. But in a 'I'm hours into this playthrough and I just realized I don't have enough high level characters to get through this battle and now I must start all over' kind of way.  If you're a perfectionist then you're going to hate this game. The game doesn't allow you to make saves. You frequently find yourself having to replay entire chapters of the game to reverse a bad decision. Even that is frequently marred by the devs' sadistic, spiteful attempts at making life difficult for you. You want to get a power save to import into the next game in the franchise? We'll make it that the point of import is hours before the end of the game. So you'll have to replay hours of the game and watch unskippable cutscenese over and over again if you want that perfect save files.  Some games feel like a labor of love. Both Banner Saga games feel like labor of spite. Spite towards Stoic's own fanbase. As you play the game you never feel appreciate. You feel like a sucker sticking out throughout the deliberate abuse the devs hurl your way. Because they want to be 'different'.  Play the game game only because you want a genuine challenge, or if you really like viking mythologies; don't play the game because you want to support indie gaming. Stoic won't thank you for it. And it showed.",-1,1

The only complaint is that map navigation both in galactic menu and solar systems leaves a lot to be desired along the lines of control. As for the rest of the game i love the epic weapons. the constant action and limitless armies you are able to produce. strategies are diverse and for the most part all counter-able, so game balance is not too much of an issue yet. i would love to see more combat unit choices to be introduced in the future including space crafts (not just orbitel tech) and stand alone space station capable of their own solar orbit as epic (t4) or expensive T3 vehicles. i would also like to see unique units in each faction or (some) planets.

268500,XCOM 2,"As a big fan of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, I was surprised to see how many things changed with XCOM 2. Along with the new futuristic setting, almost every aspect of the gameplay has been tweaked or modified in some significant way; altogether, it makes XCOM 2 feel wholly fresh and unique – even if not all of the changes are for the better.   What stood out the most early on was the steep learning curve; it wasn't until around the 30-hour mark that I felt like I had a good understanding of how things worked. The “Veteran” difficulty setting struck me as being WAY too hard for a first playthrough. I recommend setting it to the easiest mode, at least for the first bunch of hours.   Of course, the complexity that makes it hard to warm up to is part of what fuels its replay value – there is an enormous amount of depth here. You can modify soldier weapons and some of their stats with special items, equip different kinds of armor, manage research projects and constructions, keep track of limited supplies, manage special development projects and special reseach projects......umm, actually there are TOO many things to keep track of. It reminds me of the excessive micromanagement of the first Mass Effect – the depth is definitely there, but it takes too long to get anything done.   The weakest part of XCOM 2 is the story. It comes across as rather cliché average sci-fi, but at least has a very strong presentation with stylish cutscenes and good voice acting. Visually, the whole game feels “brighter” than Enemy Unknown, but still has the same great use of color and special effects. It's a lot of fun to take screenshots during the cinematic moments in battle – give it a try!  It's easy to compare XCOM 2 to Enemy Unknown and point out its flaws, but at the end of the day the turn-based strategy battles and base-management elements have a similar kind of engaging, almost compulsive appeal with very high replay value. It is intense, entertaining, and will push your intellect to the limit. Just be sure to treat this game the way you would any hostile alien: approach with caution.  (Rating: 9/10 “Great”) ",1,0
220700,RPG Maker VX Ace,"Not exactly a 'very' open software at /first glance/ but it is pretty useful. I haven't made any serious projects yet although it's easy to plan with. Mainly you just want to focus on the development process with character sprites, area textures, and events. Simple, easy to use when you eventually understand what your doing, and, in my opinion, very fun to toy around with! -As a side note: I bought this during a Steam Sale for $20 and, although I'm uncertain if there will be another one, you should probably hold off too. I've seen some spectacular stuff with 2003's version which seems to have been ported to the new version so??? Probably wait for a sale on the new software or 2003. Good luck!-",1,0

281610,Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak,"I recommend this game ONLY to see more from Homeworld in the near future. The campaign was fun, the story that is and the small videos inbetween. But it is all deserts and more deserts.  It feels like microland,, everything is so small, but when you zoom in it looks gorgeous. Sounds and visuals are from this time. But when being zoomed in you have no control of whats happening around you, as you will miss out whats happening. Also zero replayability and skirmish is a laugh, AI is dumb, but when playing on hard you get massive spam of armies. Maybe it is just me, but i long for space, maybe deserts aint my thing. I can replay HW1 and HW2 but this is missing that sweet spot of what it once was. Come on devs you can do better!  ",1,0

22320,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,"'Morrowind' dubbed '#1 rose tinted glasses game of all time'  I started playing morrowind at the ripe age of 5 years old. i would spend countless hours exploring the continent, talking to npcs and crafting my own story. morrowind was a foundation for my imagination. I have many fond memeories from this game, my homeboy Fargoth, Egg hat man, Nwah, Vivec, balmora, Toddtest, and the talking mudcrab just to name a few. the world is immersive with an interesting asthetic that had never been done before. The music is beautiful and will stay with you forever. This game is a true RPG, made before the times of catering to filthy casuals.The only thing i think is missing is a lack of playable dwarves (I know, the dwemer are basically dwarves).  I am proud to say that this game instilled the strength of 'Firmcenter' gaming within me. This has to be my favorite game, and holds a place close to my heart.   For when it was released, and what it is, i give this game 10/10",1,1

Multiple endings reflecting on your actions.    Gems:   The story is well written with so many feels through out the game.  The artwork is beautiful. The environment is simple with lovely detailed CG/pixeled backgrounds. The music is stunning. Again, it has that classic RPG feel to it. I seriously wish the was a soundtrack available.  Gameplay is not too complex. Anyone can sit and relax while playing this game without getting frusterated.  Easy, normal, and hard mode bosses for those who like a little bit of a challange.  I love they added little bit of MMORPG flair to the game. How cool is that you are can make your own armor/weapon upgrades! Battle system is unique. It took me a while to get use to using the arrow keypad. Other then that, its really simple.  Finally mutliple endings. Like I said, you get to chose your own ending.   Game is fun for being a really short one. I know people are meh when it comes to the bonus room. I find it interesting to read all the inspirations and ideas that went into this game. However the race mini game is brutal.   I really hope they make another Eternal Senia.    ",1,0

The only thing that'll keep you playing is the score and the collectables, which unlock new pets, but there are no in-game or Steam achievements, and you'll probably just leave it on longer than say 20 minutes to get the game's Steam trading cards.

There's a horror aspect to it, of course, but the player will walk away enriched in a far more profound way than that. This isn't as much a game as it is a awesome course on 'Meaning of Life' and other topics like 'Is there life after death'.  One thing is sure, if you are mature enough to appreciate the deeper questions of life then this game will be unforgetable and the most time you will spend with this game will be while you are NOT playing it.  That said, someone looking for ONLY the Horror may walk away disappointed. You get to savour quite a few hours before the ♥♥♥♥ really starts hitting the fan, so it requires more patience than your ussual run of the mill Horror experience.

242920,Banished,"  Banished   is a wonderful sim and is mechanically very similar to the economical aspect of the medieval sim     Stronghold     but without the currency aspectt. If you like a challenging game where you need to plan for the long-term to avoid failiure then you will enjoy this game.    The game   is very beginner friendly and intuitive. It has a great turorial and a very good     Wiki   [banished-wiki.com]    which contains all the necessary information.    The gameplay   is diverse, the difficulty is scalable to reflect the player's playstyle. The game can be simpe without the need to worry too much for the villagers but it can also be punishingly hard with harsh winters and the threat of natural disasters.     The game   is challenging at all stages. From having to keep your villagers from starving and freezing to having to account for several hundred villagers and their needs. However, since the game doesnt have a currency aspect you will have to trade wares to thrive and in it's current state most of the trades are favourable which removes some of the complexity of trading.    The game   has full workshop support which gives you the oppertunity to continually add content as you like. The game also seems to gradually get new content and features    So, is this game worth it's price?  -Yes Is this game for everyone?  -Is any game? Do you reccomend the game?  -Yes  ",1,0
237990,The Banner Saga,"Artistic grand journey meets minimalistic simple strategic gameplay.   The Banner Saga does very little wrong, from it's hand painted environments to it's grid-style battlefield the game is as pleasing aesthetically as it is from a gameplay perspective. Your followers are all at risk of dying by the choices you make which forces you to take a longer look at your decisions before you blindly go through with them. The story is compelling to say the least. I'm not one to upsell and I don't want to spoil much of it, however you can see the story playout from multiple perspectives and meet up 3/4ths through. The most compelling aspect of The Banner Saga, and the probably the reason I enjoyed it so much was it's ability to tell it's story so smoothly. You grow fond of characters, dislike others, silently mourn the loss of a follower or bless whatever gods these fictional warriors believe in for ridding certain individuals.

203810,Dear Esther,BUY IT BUT ONLY IF It’s on SALE FOR A DOLLAR If you think that heavy rain is NOT a game oh boy just look at Dear Ester. In this game you just walk and listen to the “audio logs”…that’s it. Story is nothing special but Dear Ester have very nice atmosphere and because of that game can made you feel some emotions. The problem is dear ester is like a ONE hour long and it has no replay value. For that price this game should be relisted as a tech demo/benchmark because is actually very nice looking and sound is not bad…but it has no Benchmark or some other demo related options and because of that 6.99 price is too much. ,1,0

The game offers an incredible amount of depth and characterisation, although it might become tedious in late-game. It is clear that a lot of thought and research has been put in the events that occur during the game, drawing you in this fantastic scandinavian and celtic mythology. I'd recommend giving it a try, maybe you could find the same level of enjoyment as I did playing it. I found the coop a bit harder to grasp, as it feels like there's not a lot of benefits from trading with the other player. Also it requires a bit more patience.",1,0

238240,Edge of Space,"For version 1.0.3  Though the developers have released this from Early Access, it really should not have been. First off, the bugs:     missing image assets     broken dialog trees/subquests     spelling mistakes     crafting window which gets laggier and laggier each time it's opened.     constant shaking of the screen when left unattended for long enough (in my case, once to answer a phone call and another to deal with a someone at the door).   Beyond the bugs, the content of the game itself is surprisingly sparse. You just constantly descend without much incentive to explore other than to discover upgrade stations. You can also find NPCs and get their subquests, but even if those subquests aren't broken there's no real payoff for completing them.  At its current level, the amount of active development and polish needed before this would be worthwhile is probably measured in months, not days or weeks. I'd check back in six months to a year to see if things have gotten better or if the move out of Early Access is an indication that the dev team is abandoning the game and so might as well call it done.",-1,1

The graphics are a little worse than I had hoped here and there but some planets still look amazing, the vistas where you can see other planets in the sky knowing you can just take off and travel to them is quite remarkable.  I don't like the fact that you can't seem to look around the cockpit or generally look down when flying.  The planetary flying itself is sometimes a little buggy and landing is a bit too imprecise. I really want more control over my height above the ground and the ability to hover would be great.  Storyline (or whatever you want to call it) is interesting. I'm not expecting anything mind boggling from it, just a reason to keep travelling and upgrading.  Overall, I like it - 8.5.",1,0

239070,Hammerwatch,"The controls, graphics, animation, and general quality are really solid, but the content is spread far too thin and the game consists of mostly doing the same things over and over. Occassionally you'll see old things mixed together in new ways - an enemy spawner next to a difficult stationary enemy, for example - but then that combination will get re-used dozens of times before you run into anything new, and that new thing may very well be a slightly faster version of an old enemy with different graphics. Tough enemies can take a minute to kill even if you're taking no damage and they pose no threat to you, making them more chore than threat, which only adds to the sense of tedium.  The difficulty is also extremely inconsistent. Some enemies plink away with 1 damage and easily avoided attacks, while more difficult to avoid attacks often take half your life bar or more. The game's first boss was vastly more difficult than the second.  I would have been happy to play this same game with levels a tenth as long and a constant stream of new situations, instead of its current form, which feels like mostly padding.",-1,1

Looking by my mere three-hour playtime, it may not seem like the game is worth it, but that's because this game is very much reminiscent of old vector graphics coin-op games like Asteroids and Missile Command. Gameplay is simple: move left and right, dodge the walls. The art is appealing, the gameplay is ridiculously easy to learn but very grueling to master, the music is fantastic, and it's a game you can easily pick up and play at literally any time for just a few seconds at a time or for an hour or two if you feel up to the challenge.

Also rogue seems like easy street haha. Like I said though I do like it, moving diagonaly would be a nice touch. The experience bar being prettied up would also be nice but obviously not important. Is the intention for us to be allowed multiple spells on our spell bar? Or to have to choose only one which we can use?  Apart from that the only thing I see as being super duper important is multiplayer, if you add multiplayer I would recommend without hesitation. Right now it is fun but a little hard due to getting one hit from bosses even on floor 1 in easiest difficulty as warrior, lol.",1,0

There were a couple of things that didn't work for me -- Shay, for example, is clearly less interesting as a protagonist than Vella, especially given some of the revelations in Act II, and there are puzzles which require you to use knowledge gained by one of the characters in the other, even though they're not in communication with each other, which is just maddening from a logical standpoint. There are also one or two puzzles that are problematic in the way they are set up.  Still, I enjoyed it. As a Kickstarter backer, I got more than my money's worth, between the 11 hours of adventure gaming and goodness-knows how many hours of documentary footage about the game's development cycle.

528820,Eisenwald: Blood of November,"Wonderful game, a great addition to Legends of Eisenwald. Really big map and a lot of things to do. Taking over enemy castles initially was hard but it was because I tried to capture them all. I changed my strategy and started taking a few and protecting them and it worked much better. Once I captured all, enemies stopped respawning, and I needed to defend my lands only against a few raubritters.   Side quests are good, many have a nice touch of humor. I really liked Underwater Bees, I think it's hilarious :) Political references are nicely done as well, not sure what others complain about. You can forget about it after all and treat it lile any other story, stories tend to repeat themselves century after century. Other pluses are: + Plenty of enemies to max out your army. + Patrol in your castle - I brought them to max level and they were able to defend my castle twice against rogue knights! It's worth training them often. + Autumn scenery. I wish original LoE had some of them, looks really nice. + Interesting quests that make you think and explore the lands.  + Huge map, I think it's the size of the biggest map in LoE. + Enemies respawn stonger. I captured all castles about a week before November 8 and chased a few bandits. Some of them got so strong I lost a battle. Don't chase bandits with skill ambush in forests, they will destroy you in the first round.  There are a few minuses though: - Saves related crashes. After a few ones I read up on forums and found that it's best to use quick save (F5) or rename standard names. For some reason, standard names saves are very likely to cause crashes.  - No endless mode. I know it's one map smaller game but I can't help wishing for some random quest generation and armies respawn. I realize it might become boring but it would be so cool to enjoy for a while a victory and rule over my lands with an iron hand :)  9 raubritters out of 10  ",1,0

At first i was slightly dubious of the graphics as when i purchased it there was not alot of gameplay videos about and it looked a little bland, but i gambled and purchased the game and i do not regret a single moment of it.  The real treat of the game is the multiplayer. I dont even know what the maximum amount of players you could have on server however when i was playing i was playing with 8 other friends. Theere has been alot of new features and content since i last played this game, i would highly recommend it to anyone.",1,0

341940,Hatred,"Hatred is by no means the best game ever made nor the most violent but there is some enjoyment to be had here. It reminds me ALOT of the original postal gameplay wise...in fact it is postal gameplay wise. Its a twin stick shooter at the most basic level.  Visually the game is alright. It by no means looks bad and it has a style that probably enhances the visuals with its crushed colors. Its a game you should be able to run at 60fps without any issue.  I had bought this game merely out of spite for all the negative press it has been getting from people who had never played it. Demonizing and calling for censorship...of a game, I wasnt expecting much from it but from what Ive played so far im enjoying it. Classic gameplay without question but its hard enough to keep you coming back and trying to keep pushing further into the levels.  Worth $20? Hard to say really. If you like twin stick shooters it might be. The game has good production quality and its not sloppy but if you dont like the genre it wont change your mind. If you are a casual fan then wait for a sale. Its a good value at $15 but paying full price is as close to showing the modern gaming press that you disaprove of their antics as you will ever get.",1,1

200510,XCOM: Enemy Unknown,"Arguably one of the best, this is definitely my favourite strategy game out there. It brings a new take on Turn based strategy, the likes of which I have not seen before. I have not played any other XCOM games so i won't be able to compare them but I will definitely go and check some out.  The backstory is somewhat generic, but fun all the same. You are defending the earth from invading aliens, and the whole of the earth is dependant on your brains. Even when you're not in battle you have to make decisions such as which countries to save, which parts of your base to expand, etc etc. You control a squad of soldiers, who get upgrades as they rank up, which makes them tougher and stronger. However the element of luck is always there, and you can never be 100% certain that you will return from a mission with you war veterans or even with the whole of, or any of your squad.  Overall XCOM enemy unknown is brilliantly designed and developed, and i can't wait to rack up some more hours on it.",1,0

65930,The Bureau: XCOM Declassified,"Okay, so before I say much I will just point out that I have not completed the game yet. I'm currently on a mission but got stuck due to a bug/glitch that makes parts of the map disappear. So, I'll restart the mission and move through it slower in order to hopefully have the map fully load.  Anyways, for what it is - A tactical shoot 'em up with placement and semi-control of your AI companions, it's quite enjoyable.  Personally I find the storyline to be quite enjoyable and cool. I also must say I love the voice acting.   Some tedious legwork in the base MAY annoy some people, understandably, but hey it's not too bad. And sometimes the NPC's will say something as you walk by. Always cool to hear what people think of your character.  In addition - You get to create four people right after the innitial mission however you want. The levelling system is intriguing as well and I find myself constantly thinking 'Wow, I feel like I'm literally an agent/group of within the XCOM base.' It's really a nice feeling when I was such a huge fan of 'Enemy Unknown'.  Is the game fun, as a baseline qualifier? Yes! It is fun! Sure, it might not be what you're looking for in an XCOM game, but it's worth the buy and the play for those of you who like FPS games. And for those of you who enjoy retroesque storylines and stuff of the like, this could also find it's way to your heart as well.  8/10 - Though, if this bug persists my rating may change to a solid 7.   If you read all of this, pat yourself on the back! Thanks for the read.  And, for the creators of The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, thank you!",1,0

Other than that, the new layout and graphic upgrade made the playthrough familiar, but very different. Having played through the game multiple times, I've memorized all the enemies. But here I treaded more carefully because there were enemies hiding behind corners and safe areas that weren't there before.  Also, the lighting system they said they were going to implicate before original DS2 came out but never did was KINDA expressed a bit here, making it practical to use a torch in some locations.  The thing that I hate though is how sparse the pvp is in this game. I'm assuming its because the community is split on the pc.   Overall pretty damn good 8.7/10 ",1,0

2100,Dark Messiah of Might & Magic Single Player,"Come for the kicking stay for the stealth.  Frankly this one of the most unintentionally funny games I've played and at times it's also genuinely fun to play. That said it's not without an abnormally large number of problems I'll be getting into. The game runs like butter in 4k maxed out (Source engine game from 06 after all) and the visuals have held up well overall thanks to some fancy lighting effects and general visual flair and well as a reliance on physics that would make Half-Life 2 blush. The lip sync is great and the animation is decent even though that's primarily because it's a Source engine game and you'll often recognize some canned animations reused over and over if you've played other titles on the engine. Faces are a mixed bag with some humans looking great and others obviously not being capable of and facial animation. All the monsters look great but the people aren't all well detailed and are sometimes more ghoulish than the beasts you encounter funnily enough.  One thing that could have made up for the wonky animations would have been good voice acting but unfortunatley that's another thing this game lacks to a frankly laughable degree. Things like he ability to see your feet and phyisically use your hands to pick objects up in the world (In addition to some slightly sickening head bobbing) make up for that quite a bit and can make it incredibly immersive at times even if you'll see your sword floating out of your hands or just walk past all the enemies like I did. The overly drawn out tutorial followed by a long drawn out linear opening are a few issues that keep you from getting into the meat and potatos of the game but during this time you'll have held every useless object in your hand (if your me) or destroyed everything with your awesome kick.  There is stealth, there's magic, swordplay (You can dual weilding daggers, using a sword and sheild, just a sword or a staff all of which can also be used to block with), archery and donkey kong which is my preffered playstyle. The most effective weapon is the ♥♥♥♥ lying on the floor. You'll find yourself mostly jumping on enemies as it ragdolls them even when they are already lying down, picking up a body to block attacks, kicking people and generally being merciless as enmies limp away only to get kicked. While kicking has limited stamina it's quite useful as ledges and spikes are everywhere. It kind of reminds me of Theid with the whole game feeling like a source engine version of that title for better or worse.  It's biggest problem is the lack of polish which only effects the 2 of the 3 most important things in the game those being the the gameplay and story. It's a wee bit janky and the occasional badly compressed FMV's are another thing that makes it a chore to sit through. In Half-life 2 if you got bored at least you could climb around the room and throw stuff. Funnily enough NPC's actually react twoards your bad behavior for the most part outside of cutscenes but then the game will reload a past checkpoint after you've been chastized even if all you did was throw a bottle or jump on someones head. I guess this is also because unlike Half-Life 2 you can ALSO kill pretty much anybody which could have lead to some awkward moments if you walked into a room and accidentally killed off an important charcter needed for progression.  I disliked everybody I met in the game which is why it's a bummer I can't just kill everybody all the way until the end of the game. Regardless the price is right and I advise anybody who hasn't already to pick it up as there is a lot of freedom in terms of what means you use to progress.  I don't know if it's really good or really bad but overall I reccomend it. Oh and Ubisoft AND Arkane had a hand in it whcih probably explains a lot.",1,0

370240,NBA 2K16,"Awful. Are you looking for a game where you can play basketball or a game where you are a coach and run a team. Of the later is the case, it's a pretty good gsme but if your actually looking to enjoy playing a game you are out of luck. For a $50+ game you need to spend additional money to buy coins to upgrade your character and get customation features like tatoos and clothing, which is utterly ridiculous. Unless you do this to upgrade you are Awful and can't make a ♥♥♥♥, defend, or dribble to save your life. Which inhibits how well you can do, which inhibits your ability to improve. Addittionally the controls are nightmarish. No longer can a relative amateur sit down and play. You need to one use every button(gamepad) or your entire keyboard to move your character, control their dribble, time your shot, order other players, and design team plays. You litterally don't ever play just one player as you need to design plays and order the other players, who by the way, sometimes ignore you. Unless you are a fantasy team maker and know all the players stats and team strategies you will be utterly lost. Oh, and did I mention that your coach will bench you for significant portions of the game?  That's not all. No longer is this a game where you get to play. Every five minutes is interrupted by a feature length film. Why would I want to watch fake highlights of the game I just played. I don't need to sit through sports commentary on my career. I want to play the damn game. Literally every quarter there is a video of going to the locker room or sitting with the coach. Then between games there is your sponsors, your family, and other garbage to sit through. I like having a bit of commentary during the game to make it feel more real but this is ridiculous. However, if you like that stuff them it won't be a problem.",-1,0
282800,100% Orange Juice,"While some might criticize the choice strictly for the themes involved, 100% OJ is actually a very well-structured and fairly balanced game. Easy to learn but tough to master, it's nice to pass the time with and has plenty of replayability in terms of multiplayer and the near infinite combinations of decks, characters, and maps. There's also plenty to unlock in terms of cosmetics, and it's especially refreshing to see a game completely free of micro-transactions and the pay-to-win mentality, as none of the unlockables give any advantage, just spruce up characters to taste. Not to mention the game is still being supported years after release with content updates, DLCs, new achievements, and seasonal events.  One bit of advice though: Stay off the boards. While at times friendly, the community is surprisingly elitist when it comes down to it, perhaps because the Fruitbat devs monitor their forums closely enough to equate feedback into rebalancing, and this has spoiled the recipients somewhat.

375230,"Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade","During the lead up to release I was of the opinion that this game was unrecoverable, but I think it's gone from unrecoverable to suitably recoverable in a few patches. It still has many issues and incomplete features, and is likewise not worth $40 unless you are a 40K fan (and regularly pay $40 for a box of plastic men still on the sprues).  What is it: Eternal Crusade is a lobby third-person shooter set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. The ideal gamemode is about 16 v 16. There is facilitation of both melee and ranged gameplay. Players can customize their loadouts with things like power swords, combi-bolters, lascannons, artificier armor, power klaws, meltaguns, and so on. You can play as an Ork, a Space Marine, a Chaos Space Marine, or as an Eldar. Each faction has classes set up in a similar manner to Team Fortress 2. The melee combat is sort of a rock-paper-scissors setup where heavier melee weapons endure longer when 'rock meets rock'.  Largest issue: Movement The animations are clunky and inorganic. You cannot jump unless you have a jetpack, so a tiny bump in the ground can prevent you from moving or even combat-rolling over it. Melee attacks teleport you forwards; it is a 'lunge'. Besides technical issues like desync or framerate, it is an issue in large melee cluster♥♥♥♥s because everyone is teleporting around. 'Battle lines' do not form so allies (or enemies) shooting into the melee end up shooting you or your allies just about as much as they shoot their intended target.  Vehicle movement is just as bad. Invisible walls or environmental objects prevent you from doing anything creative with vehicles. You are restricted to narrow predetermined paths.  Further:  The game has an issue communicating what is happening on-screen. Many actions do not have sounds, their sound doesn't always play, or their sound effect is not audible enough, whether from low volume or lack of punctuation. An example of this is throwing grenades. Sometimes your character will announce throwing the grenade. Sometimes they won't. Sometimes you will hear and see the grenade throw animation. Sometimes you won't. Almost all of the time you won't even hear the grenade explode.  Another isssue is that the player camera is too close to your character and your FOV is very restricted. Space Marine [Game] did that better, there is just no question about it.  The game has a PvE mode against Tyranids. It is an incomplete feature. Just ignore it.  It is a full-priced game with micro-transactions concerning functional items (weapons) and cosmetic-only items. Players power increases with level and due to low population will inevitably throw max level players with low level players. There are RNG lootboxes for weapon mods and skins.  Items cannot be melted in exchange for credits, though you can't get duplicates, so eventually a tier of lootbox will tell you that you already have all the items you can get with that lootbox. You can access all weapon types without paying any more than the base price with a bit of in-game earned currency.  The interface requires 7 clicks to get to a weapon and modify it or change it.  There are balance issues (one faction more powerful than all others).  Overall I applaud the developers for being brave enough to work on this game and release it in the end, but it is a mess and every aspect of the game's design could have been better if it were copied from another game, and pasted here with a Warhammer skin on it. It tries to copy Space Marine [Game] and fails; it tries to be unique and succeeds in creating a uniquely terrible game.  I am sorry, guys. I know you worked really hard but your last hope is to delay the console release as much as possible and hope it attracts a crowd there. Here, on Steam, this game risks being unrecoverable. I thank you for all the hard work you have done, and I will enjoy it as much as I can.",-1,1

The kingdom management is probably the shallowest aspect of the game; still fun but less interesting as choices dwindle. Character classes are an interesting lot, and the leveling system feels good.

It really adds nothing to the genre and tbh is inferior in almost everyway to other titles on the market (Civ5 anyone? Anyone for a game of civ5?) The only noteworthy thing about it is the ship builder, if you can get over the clunky interface...  I don't know, maybe it's worth picking up in a sale? It's really not worth the asking price (and the cost of dlc on top of that) This is a £20 game to me at most, not £40 plus another 20 in dlc.",-1,1

48220,Might & Magic: Heroes VI,"Reviews clearly don't mean anything to the Steam community because somehow this abomination keeps doing well in sales.  If you're a fan of the Heroes of Might &amp; Magic series, avoid this defecation of a 'game' at all costs, because it removes just about everything interesting and fun about the previous games and replaces it with a generic cut and dry style of play that robs the factions of their uniqueness and dumbs the game down into an extremely predictable, formulaic experience.  If you're not a fan of the HoMM series, please, go and buy ANY OTHER Heroes game. If this is the first game in the series you play you'll probably wonder why they made 6 of them considering what an absolute piece of unfun trash this one is. I would recommend this to new players even less than I would to fans because at least fans might appreciate some small scrap buried deep down in the remains of what is now barely recognizable as HoMM.  Oh, it's also horrendously buggy two years after release. It got I think 3 patches released before Ubisoft stopped supporting it and just started releasing DLC. This is nothing but a shameless cash grab, milking dry a classic franchise that could've had so much left to give if Ubisoft wasn't such a terrible company. They drove the original developers to bankruptcy and brought in a team of unknowns for a very short time after release to salvage the mess as much as they could - there were constant crashes and glitches that would totally halt your progress through a campaign mission and force a restart, and some of these persist to this day.  And then there's the highly intrusive uPlay integration for those of you who dislike aggressive 3rd party DRM on your Steam games.  Overall there is no reason for anyone to buy this game. If just one person sees this review and chooses not to give Ubisoft their money because of it, it was worth typing out.",-1,0

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,This is a very unique game in a good way. One thing needs to be said is that this game is not for everyone. This game takes patients and a lot of skill for the first play through. Expect to get lost now and then. The game gives you an objective but no pointer/map. It’s your duty to explore and figure it out yourself. So if you don’t like a game holding your hand and want something challenging this game is perfect for you.   Pros -Great story - Fun to play with friends -Must adapt to all bosses -Great world design -Customization Cons -Need a controller  -Have to use a summoning symbol to play with others.

Further, there is much more mathematical and stats depth to this game than what I initially expected. You can really self-modify this game (don't confuse this as a software mod, I am referring to modifying settings and difficulties in-game). There are many different ways to earn bonuses via the stratified difficulty settings by category and type. The variables are so many - each playthrough of this game could become very unique. This is like RPG meets Tower Game. Admittedly, I am satisfied especially with the 75% off sale price during the current Steam sale, so if you're waiting for a similar price point, it comes around.",1,0

The map is just colossal (larger than GTA 5's map) and so versatile with vast and clear blue ocean, snowy mountains, tropical forests, deserts and city environments. The story is hilarious! You, Rico Rodrigez (badass), team up with 3 criminal factions in order to overthrow a crazy midget president (yes a midget) by causing loads of explosions. This game is so expansive and crazy, it's the epitome of open world. And then there's the free multiplayer mod, all the explosive madness of the single player just with 1000 more players, absolutly hilarious. For a game thats 5 years old Just Cause 2 is absolutly amazing. If you can't wait for Just Cause 3 (which i'm so looking forward to) then buy it! Explosion!",1,0

426330,MetaHuman Inc.,"This game was amazing, plain and simple. Trying to explain the plot is so difficult because of the interwoven themes and genres that baffles me still about how well it works.   Mechanically, I never felt once like my choices were just tossed off and without meaning, just a number that ultimately turns out the same. Every choice had weight. Some choices were difficult. Some were ultimately very satisfying. All were interesting.  That is something -very- hard to pull off these days, but through masterful writing and an impactful story, they have made it real.   All in all, this game is way more than what I had purchased it for. Not just for the fact that I'm probably going to restart the experience anew right after writing this, but for an experience unlike any story I've seen or heard of before. This is a rare gem, and I thank the creator for it graciously.",1,1
281240,Adventure Chronicles: The Search For Lost Treasure,"I remember enjoying Escape The Museum, the previous game, where the heroin was stuck in her museum with her daughter after a violent earthquake. Here, Susan is contacted by a mysterious man that will trigger a trip all around the world.  Adventure Chronicles is belonging to what I call the early era of hidden objects games, in other words, where you're cleaning scenes by finding items on a list. So don't expect a game where you're roaming around and solving puzzles. However, the game adds some elements like items you need to dust/find in broken containers/behind burnable stuff. In other words, you'll have a lighter, an hammer and a brush to help you. Other items will need specific ones that will be used only in the scene. There is also a 'geocache' object to discover, with a riddle describing it.  While the game can be finished quickly, if you want a 100%, you're free to come back a second time in the scenes to find another list. It's a nice way to invite you to play it completely.  However, keep in mind that some objects are little in size or so well hidden that you can't see them without a proper orientation of your screen. This is the main problem with these games from the first era and Adventure Chronicles doesn't escape from that.  The backgrounds are correct and the soundtrack is also nice.  That said, Adventure Chronicles, while I love it as I've played a retail version of it years ago, right now, in 2015, should mainly enjoy the hardcore fans - as the genre headed towards an adventure oriented mechanics and that new fans will be probably disappointed and be bored quickly.",1,0
330840,Game of Thrones - A Telltale Games Series,"I bought this game as soon as it came out.  I don't regret my purchase, but I wish I had waited until the end. The episodes are too spaced out for you to remember everything that you did and who all the characters are.   Time will tell, but it really doesn't seem like the choices I made matter that much. Every time you get things working for your house, no matter how good or bad they are, you seem to get knocked back to square one.   I still look forward to the rest of the game, but I think the game left a lot of potential on the table with the IP and the nature of all the 'what-ifs' in the series.",1,0

Maps are fun to make, and game is really easy to mod for your own server.    Dedicated server is Linux (Might have a windows version now, Pasi is a very hard worker.)    Pasi did an aawesome job on the controls. You can sit down, and pick this game up with verry little instructions.     Few contols to confuse things. Gameplay is very fast and fluid     You can Prone, Kneel, and stand shoot just like any 3D shooter worth its weight in salt.    This game is soooo much better than Capcom Commando!

220440,DmC Devil May Cry,"DMC is all about the action, and it definitely delivers in that regard. Fighting as Dante, you are able to pull off some of the most incredible combos with your weapons. By the end of the game, you have quite the arsenal and it is incredibly rewarding to incorporate your many weapons into your combos. From the fast angel weapons, the reliable sword, or the slow but powerful demon weapons, I found that I used all of his melee weapons regularly. The ranged attacks were less interesting. Swinging to and pulling enemies was also incredibly fun. The story was fine, but nothing special overall. The characters were interesting overall, with Kat and Mundus being some good examples. There was also a nice sense of progression due to how rapidly you unlocked both new weapons, abilities, and combos. There were also several very humorous parts, and the music is very adrenaline-rushing-good. All in all, I'm pleased with DMC. The Vergil's Fall DLC continued the story further, but Vergil was not quite as fun to play with as Dante. It was interesting to utilize the same combat system with a different skillset, and Vergil's increased ranged strength was nice. However, his 3 melee weapons did not offer much in the way of variety. Also, the story here is even weaker than the base game, which docked some of the points overall. The one flaw with the game was that the camera control could be quite frustrating at times, and I also felt like I lost more health from missing jumps than I did in fights. I do look forward to other Ninja Theory combat games after this impressive title.  85/100 ",1,0

220240,Far Cry® 3,"SINGLE PLAYER - Nearly a perfect sandbox first person shooter  MULTIPLAYER -  The actual multiplayer is fun and fast paced. The issue? The multiplayer is so broken that it could take you literally an hour to find a game, and after one game, Farcry 3 will crash. After every multiplayer game. This is because Ubisoft chooses to not have dedicated servers and make people play through their service called uPlay. You can't play with steam friends. You have to add your friends on uPlay. You don't get steam achievements, you get uPlay achievements. uPlay is literally the dumbest thing ever and Ubisoft should be ashamed of themselves for releasing Farcry 3 and not EVER fixing the multiplayer crashes and bugs. I'm not the only one who experiences this, almost every player who plays on direct x11 will deal with it. A small number of people can play fine with Direct 9x but why limit yourself so much graphical degration for a game you payed for that should of been COMPLETE. I'm never buying another Ubisoft game again. They lost my buisness and i highly reccommend you not buy any Ubisoft games if your interested in playing any Multiplayer. They've also been known to intentionally degrade graphics on PC on some of their games to make it look more like the console versions. (Watch Dogs for example) Thumbs up my review, let people know before they buy. The decision is yours!",-1,1

Isaac is one of the games that it's gameplay is superior. It perfectly balances action and adventure and as for replay value I believe is infinite. There's just too many good things in this game.

The game follows Marius' efforts to defend the people of Rome and flashbacks reveal his past campaigns and experiences leading up to the final battle.  Looks awesome, but enemies only have a few different skins (so you kill the same people hundreds of times) and the game is basically the same thing over and over in different places.  This is a game I do like, but wouldn't say is a must-play.  As far as medieval sword and shield combat is concerned it is solid, very addicting to play.   Once you get the hang of it it is a lot of fun, but the plot is a stereotypical historical-looking fantasy revenge story.  The multiplayer has great replay value, but can still get old after awhile.

249050,Dungeon of the ENDLESS™,Nice combination of several mechanics that create a pretty unique tactical turn based yet real time strategy. It's got a good sense of aesthetics and it feels nice and beefy in content. The additional unlockable companions and ships are a neat touch.   Watch a video or two and you'll get a good idea of if you want to play this game or prefer to watch others play it for your entertainment. Picked it up at 50% off for the 2014 winter sale and I think it was totally worth it.,1,0
425150,Assassins vs Pirates,"Haven't played too much so far but it's definitely interesting. Mechanics are simple, although controls take some time to get used to and to master (I'm still learning), There is a decent amount of maps and modes to play, the graphics are nice and the music is pleasing to the ears. It lacks single player mode though and there aren't that many players online so far so if you don't have friends who also own this game you need to reconsider buying this game. Also, since there are no categories for players you may end up against a true master and be slaughtered. Still I recommend trying this game because it is fun, just be sure to not reach 2h limit in case you think it's not your cup of tea.",1,0
92000,Hydrophobia: Prophecy,"Bought this in the sales for £3, an interesting and engaging title, if a little too short. The game throws you in at the deep end, literally, and you take control of the female protagonist as you try to figure out exactly wtf is going on, a decent variation in gameplay keeps the whole thing flowing nicely and whilst the voice acting isn't exactly Oscar winning material, it's decent enough.  Keeping in mind this a small Indie developer title, i was pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable it was, some gripes i have with the game: It CTD five times, all during the first act, which resulted in the game being unable to detect my savegames next time i ran it, thankfully they were all still there, the game just refused to 'see' them. The devs are aware of this and say that simply quitting and restarting the game fixes it, sadly not for me, so i resorted to starting a new game and copying my old savegames over the new ones, the game was then able to see them fine. I'd still recommend it though.",1,0

253030,Race The Sun,"A nice decent game. I got it for free, (which was great) and I'm pretty satisfied. It's a nice relaxing game game, with no clear objective or storyline. The plot is that you are a solar-powered craft flying and the sun, which powers your craft, is setting. You can collect energy boosts that, for a split second, stop the sun from setting. The endless concept is not something new (at all), but this game is. Good graphics and ambience, and it kind of reminds me of an iPad game I have called Forever Drive  (https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/forever-drive/id442923846?mt=8)  which had futuristic graphics with an endless concept AND a map editor- a perfect replica, only race-themed.

218410,Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten,"I first played the demo version on my old laptop (R.I.P) four years ago after seeing it on XGen. I was really addicted to it, even though it was short 'cuz it was a demo. I was amazed by it's unique gameplay, setting and mostly the music. I remember that I kept humming the soundtrack for it all the time. I then forgot about the game, and soon, my laptop broke. Fast forward four years later, seeing this on sale in Steam. When I saw it, I thought 'Hey, why not buy it after all these years?' and so I did.  The game now looks different, however the soundtrack and the gameplay is still the same. Then I looked into the options and saw you can change the art style to the original one. Obviously, I picked the original, since the game feels more better that way. It's better to play it like you've played it before.   I really recommend this game because of the unique gameplay, and you could probably fall in love with the soundtrack. I am currently humming the map theme now as I type this review. There's really not much else to say, since it's better if you experience it first-hand. Go on, get it while it's on sale. Totally worth it.",1,0

242820,140,"140 is an amazing platformer game. It took me about 3 hours to complete the normal levels, and it was very fun. I totally recommend this game to anyone who is thinking of spending their money on it. If you're like me, the difficulty of the levels will make you focus more. But if you're not like me, you'll probably be throwing your computer out the window on the final level.  Ratings: Music: 10/10 - Amazing soundtrack! The way the sounds of the objects doing different things morph in with the soundtrack is really nice. The soundtrack is definitely my favorite part of this game. I would normally put a 'Sound Effects' thingy after this one, but, the sound effects are practically the music... Graphics: 7/10 - Minimalistic graphics, but that doesn't take away the fun of the game! Gameplay: 9/10 - Gameplay difficulty is well-balanced. The only part I don't like is that part before the final boss where you have to jump across cubes that are expanding and shrinking, while huge cubes of static slam down on them, squashing you. Overall: 9/10",1,1

Its a refreshing change from my usual diet of aim heavy FPS games (Quake, Dirty Bomb etc..) although quite similar to Dirty Bomb in its own way with the combination of team composition, positioning and wave timing being important for success (at least in Meltdown)  I love shooters but find MOBA's too boring, this takes the two styles and makes a whole new fun one of its own.  -- EDIT After playing over another 100 hours --  Still playing Meltdown and still enjoying it as much as the first week. Sure, there are a lot of issues that they need to look at :  1. Matchmaking 2. Frame rate for certain maps (and AMD cards in general) 3. Scoring system encouraging kills rather than objectives (minions etc..)  but the core gameplay is so good that I keep coming back night after night.   There seems to be relatively few games these days where you can really mount an amazing comeback..You're over 100 minions down, 1 guy keeps calling a surrender vote, everyone else is saying keep calm, just get some levels and stick together and slowly but surely everyone starts to focus together, the waves get cleared, you pick off a few kills, the minion scores start to even up and you can feel the other team start to lose hope, they start throwing themselves at you but never quite getting enough kills to turn the tide of the comeback. In the last few minutes of the game the minion scores goes in our favour and its a glorious hard won victory. NEVER SURRENDER.  If you're the kind of person who likes a game with layers and depth that really rewards how much time you put in I can't recommend this enough.  (Again, this is all Meltdown, tbh I think it would have made a great game all by itself)",1,0

The game is really vertical in nature, meaning you can climb ledges and rafters to find safer routes.  All in all a very fun title, if not quite a classic. Graphics are nothing particularly great but more than adequate, and the only real minus are the occasionally clumsy controls + the annoying boss fight.

235540,Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide,"I have a few hours in this game now, enough to say that I can write a review.  Firstly if you are into visceral melee combat in a game, this is your game. There are points where you are swamped by so many Skaven (Rat men to the non initiated) that swiping your attack through the heads of many is as enjoyable combat can get in any game.  While many play this sort of genre because they like zombies, and I forsee some not liking it because they are rats (My fiancé is a LFD2 fan 1500+ hours) but for anyone who just loves the play style then you will love this game.  Graphics: The graphics are modern, dark, dirty, medievalesque with a high attention to detail. The immersion brought on by the graphics is superb. Walking around a corner and seeing a Skaven shadow cast on the floor as it's creeping over the roof above you, to only be skewed by a teammates arrow as his head appears over the ridge, I have an asus gaming laptop and this game runs exceptionally smoothly at 1080 ultra wide with everything up to high, no slow down at all.  Sound: The voice acting is the most shining star in this the audiophiles torrent of sound. Each character, each script is perfectly chosen. The skaven themselves taunt you, talk amongst themselves when they think they are alone, and the ominous tone of the Skaven attack bell is enough to send a weight into the pit of your stomach.  Gameplay: Apart from the obvious afore mentioned viscaral combat, and what seems to be exceptionally balanced items. The gameplay is a good mix of horde/tank/scavenger gameplay with some interesting things into the mix. One of these things are that there are multiple paths and plenty of hidden areas to explore as you race through the map. Stay in place too long however unique rats, assasins, ratling gun skaven, packmasters, globe throwers are there to attack you at random. But these special rats are NOTHING when compared to the Rat Ogre. This brute can be agroed with ranged weapons with ease, however his blows are nothing short of untankable almost all the time. In harder difficulties these special Skaven can wipe your team in second. However for me, the sound I dread is the marching, clanking formation of the elite Skaven pack rats. Their high HP, high damage if allowed to surround your team will annhilate you faster than you can regroup.  One last thing. Expect to fail if you go alone with bots they can't cut it with only one real person in the team. Also expect to fail in your first couple of runs unless you are carried by your team. This game is different and it will take some getting used to. However, you will take some Skaven heads, you will be spinning around for where that Assasin went, and you will run from the ratogre.",1,0

The Joker gives a stellar performance, with Harley Quinn, and his various clowny goons for backup, in what amounts to a fantastic piece of 'experience' gaming, allowing you to take on the role of the Batman himself, and all of his gadgets, gizmos, whatsits, and his predatory shadow stalking style. Arkham is mostly open to player exploration and includes many little secrets to unlock and discover, but many of the areas have to be unlocked through story progression or attaining a specific type of gaget.

275850,No Man's Sky,"Welp tired of seeing so many reviews from people with under an hour play time. Even just a few hours rlly isnt enough to give it a good review. People i guess were just itching to write negative reviews when this came out lol I mean theres always gonna b issues on launch, especially nowadays xD No need to say the game is complete garbage cuz of it -_- But heres my view on the game so far at 12 hours playtime:   The game progresses a bit slow until you get use to how things work and what you need to do. there is a bit of key objectives that do progress u in the universe. After doing these objectives some things will then start showing up, one example is an anomoly that was suddenly in an old solar system i recently explored. If your someone who wants some super fast pace fps shooter with mild exploration, this isn't for you. its a casual pace exploration with a wide variety of environments. i believe, not 100% sure, u'll see a more variety of planets and creatures the farther you go in the main objectives and farther you explore from your starting spot. You'll gradually learn a bunch of different languages that help you with speak to creatures, which cang et you nice stuff. you'll stock up of tons n tons of upgrades for everything which lets you custimize what your using for how u like it. If you want a bullet bouncing, cone exploding plasma gun, you can do that, or you want a mining lazer that will never overheat and does huge damage to creatures, you can do that too. all these mods r based off your one muli tool you start with. you eventually find ones with more slots for upgrades which let you really deck out your gun to your liking. Same custimization goes for your ship and even your exosuit. And the only way to find so many blueprints is simply exploring, cant really rush the game to get a decent experience at all. Planets i explored never had too many creatures(yet) n most were barren with not much vegitation but closer you get to center the more plentiful the planets become(from what i read that is). the combat is a bit funky at first as well(still getting use to space fights xD) but its satisfying when you get use to it :D so Overwall:  Cons:  -Very Time consuming -slow progression -Not an action packed fps -Cant build structures(as far as i know atm) -Space fights are tough to get use to -Can have bad spawn locations(such as super cold/hot temps or radiation) -limit starting inventory space  Pros: -Looks amazing -lots to explore -Nice casual gameplay (space fights r evil tho) -a lot of diff creatures(some are basicly reskinned tho) -Simply Fun and entertaining -earnng ingame cash isnt hard -a lot of surprises with every solar system(anomolys, black holes, space pirates, ect) -able to custimize weapon/personal suit/space ship -tons of mods for gear -Get to break into places with explosives @_@ - much more since i barely scratched the surface of this game  Overwall if your not sure wether to get this game you can wait it out. see more vids and reviews, but if your looking for a casual game to kill some time and you enjoy exploring new areas, then BUY IT. You'll love it ^^ ",1,0

304050,Trove,"Here is an honest review...  The game itself is great. It's basically what Cube World was suppose to be and more. If you don't know what Cube World was, then let me go ahead and just describe what Trove is instead. In Trove you can go into randomly generated worlds filled with dungeons and a scant few other interesting things. Clear dungeons for loot, mine for ore, fish, etc. The goal is pretty much just to level up and get the best gear, so it's not unlike other MMOs in that sense. The game also features some optional building elements (building a home/etc).   All of that being said, the game suffers from major server issues. Trion, the developers, are notorious for hosting their games on extremely low quality servers and Trove is no exception to this. 'Rubberbanding', or the server lagging to the point that you are instantly reverted to your previous location from a few secions prior, is a common occurance. Waiting for the server to load the land infront of you is not in any way uncommon. The average ping you could expect to be playing is is anywhere from 200 to 1,000. Now 1,000 ping may seem bad, but it's a hell of a lot better then when the servers are down, which is quite often. There is rarely a day that goes by when the servers are not shut down, without any warning might I add, for an hour or two. Pretty much every time the game is updated, majory or just by a hotfix, you should expect the servers to be down anywhere from 2 to 12 hours.",-1,0

391540,Undertale,"Well......after playing through this game on my first run I can say I enjoyed my experiece with a few execeptions. 1st you walk considerably slow and the amount of walking is a lot but I wouldn't say the experience is too hinderd by this. 2nd the shops are few and far between and when there is a shpop most of them you can't sell anything to which makes an inventory surplus and it can be a big problem. 3rd Item slots you only get 8 and it makes storing things difficult that you want to use on hand but, ill give it that it does have a box storage system so it's not too bad. On the positives the characters are VERY funny and VERY memmorable hands down my favorite part of the game Sans and Papyrus are super funny and cool and always seem very good too be around and it's a very fun game and I HIGHLY recommend it to people wether fans of RPG's or not. This game gets my rating of 9.8/10   *UPDATE*   OK so after the true ending despite the flaws listed above this game now definitly without a doubt gets a 15/10",1,1

373290,Stones of Sorrow,"complete trash. it uses a ton of music from actual bands that i highly doubt it has any legal rights to use. all the controls are completely unresponsive, from moving, to jumping, to attacking. sometimes they work, sometimes they dont. it has NOTHING to do with stamina. sometimes when you attack enemies, nothing happens. but every enemy can easilly kill you and will hit every time they swing their 'wepon'. even if they are nowhere near you.  you collect money to level up, but the level ups are pointless. you can only recover health by spending all your money at a shop and hoping its random drop is health. its usually 30 different crappy wepons you cant get rid of however, and then have to cycle through every time you pick up something new, to find the highest attack again. usually youlll have to cycle multiple times, since the wepon or relics effect/stats are displayed for all of 1/10th of a second most of the time. increasing strength slightly increase damage, you can increase dodge roll 'speed' which dosent actually seem to do anything, and increase your health. even with max health, youll die in no time at all. even with all the perks (which you can only buy 1 of each death, regardless of your money), you dont stand a chance. you can eventually eat corpses i you cheat enough money in (youre not doing this legit. dont lie.), but youll die about 1/3 of the time when you eat a corpse, and they provide hardly and health.  this game is complete trash. a waste of 99 cents. no responses from the developer can possibly change this. and i hope that the 'developer' is stealing the music, so he can spend some time in prison away from 'developing' 'games'.",-1,0

225080,Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons,THIS GAME LOOKS BEAUTIFUL!!!!   If you enjoy games that have great atmosphere and music (like Trine) then you will love this game.   Unfortunately it's over way too fast with a play time of 3-4 hours depending on whether you spend time trying to get the achievements and how much time you spend soaking in the beautiful scenery. The game is pretty linear and the puzzles are mostly designed to see how well you can manipulate both control sticks and triggers (I highly recommend a gamepad) at the same time. The story is also fairly simple with the characters only communicating in gestures and a sort of gibberish leaving the story to be told through the visuals (did I mention that they're beautiful).  As beautiful as the game is $15 is a little bit steep in my opinion unless you REALLY like just walking around listening to music and looking at the visuals instead of proceeding with the story. It has been on sale for pretty cheap many times and I definitely recommend picking it up on sale.,1,0

50130,Mafia II (Classic),"80% - Mafia II: The Real Mafia Experience  This game opens up as an interesting story that keeps going until ends up on an even more interesting story, going from a thief wanna-be that joins the US Army Light infantry Airborne unit to ends up as one of the biggest Mob leaders of New yor...... Empire city.  The first mafia has been just a rip off from The Godfather (IMHO, best PS2 game ever). But this game REALLY does a good justice to the genre of mobsters sandbox. Of course, there are flaws, but nothing too big. The weapons are somewhat lacking, and the ammo is not universal between some of them like how it should be (the .45 ammo used in both M1911, and both Thompsons) and the Crosshairs are not really useful either at all... but this is not the first time we have seen this, so its not really game-breaking.  The graphics DOES looks dated somewhat, then again, we are talking about an 2010 game here, but trust me, it won't look like that in a lot of times, the biggest complaint would be also that the Cutscenes are not rendered with the same quality than the in-game engine, but that they are inferior too (something odd and EXTREMLY rare in games). But the shadow quality is at least, good, and i cant say much bad about the textures either.  The game tries too hard to be interactive, maybe a little bit too hard. Some parts of it itself are glitching because the interaction is up to where your character is looking, not where you are pointing at, and being a Third Person Shoter, that's not a good idea. Not that its a big problem, after all, almost nothing that you can do inside your house is really useful... you will be only using the fridge, the guardrobe, maybe the radio, and the phone for certain missions.  Talking about the radio, a big complain would be the lack of radio stations, in the first part of the game that takes in the 1945 has just 3 radio stations (too little) but at least the song in them its not bad, its pretty good. Then, after the second half wich takes you into the US of 1951, the radio stations are there, with the music of the time, not even their names changed.  Now that i mentioned the second half, i have to say, its REALLY well done as an enviroment, some places changed, the cars changed, and you can see everything by yourself how the whole US changes in the time of the war and after the war.  The main difference of the 2 parts would be the weather, wich in the first part is snowing (vehicle handling is affected) and the second part is Autumn/Summer.  About vehicle handling: Its no TDU or car simulator, but its doing a pretty damn good job at it. I haven't touched the arcade setting, but the realistic vehicle handling its just fantastic.  The AI its just the good old classic Sandbox AI, TERRIBLE. And the cops may look like if they took car driving lessons from the ones in GTA. But at last, the Cops AI its not so bad, it does behaves somewhat in a realistic manner, the only exception would be that going over a red light its not considered law infringement, or at least i haven't been chased by passing over a red light.  This game is FORCING YOU to stay in cover, wether this is good or bad, its up to you. Also, i should be explaining that the AI only reacts to you, yes, granted, this is better than COD, friendly AI actually does something, but the game really put the spotlight on you.  The system to buy things is bad. You cant buy cars, the tunning its not good until you have unlocked everything in the last section of the game, and the cloth stores do not tell you wich item you have already bought before, or wich one you haven't. This is turning the game into a more GTA IV style approach, as you cant even buy houses (not that it really matters, as there are just 4 houses for you, starting one, first half, mid half, and a bad last half one).  The dialog is greatly written, and there is nothing else to say that i just love it.  You WILL have to remember that this game doesn't give a thing about your money, as in 2 parts of the game they force you to leave everything behind.  There is a lotpicking minigame to steal cars, but dont get too excited, it may be silent, but its still attracting cops, its not really realistic at all (how hard would it be to make it realistic? really!), but its a nice add to the general game.",1,0

203160,Tomb Raider,"THE ONLY BUG IN THE GAME: I'll start with the one thing which broke the atmosphere of the game, (for me anyway), the bug which exists in the DLC tomb. I got annoyed with this because i simply don't expect there to be a bug in the DLC, but it wasn't really all that much of an issue to be honest.  THE FIX: Simply leave the tomb and re-enter it and the bug will auto-fix meaning you can complete the tomb.   That was the ONLY issue i had with the game, the rest of the game played flawlessly for me from start to finish.   A BIT OF A POINTLESS RAMBLE: I've played most of the Tomb Raider series from the Playstation 1 era, and while i never completed them and found them boring after a while because i didn't know where to go (my fault) i still bought the next installment of the game when it was released because there was something that i did enjoy about the games.   Since the PS1 era games, i haven't played another Tomb Raider until this one, and since playing this one i have the urge to go and get the others before it and play them, not sure why, but i do.   REVIEW:  I enjoyed Tomb Raider from start to finish, minus the DLC bug, but even the DLC was worth it as it added some more room for learning and getting familiar with the mechanics of the game a little more.  Everything from the look of the game (graphics and art style) to the voice acting and gameplay mechanics made this game very immersive, and i felt like i actually cared about the main character. There was at times the old fashioned Tomb Raider camera niggles leaving you not totally sure about where to jump next, but i found that just going with the flow worked out rather than thinking about it too long.   The gameplay is fluid and the puzzle solving isn't overly complicated or complex to the point of silly, if anything I'd say they lightened up a little in this department, (going from memory of the Tomb Raider games on PS1), but the puzzles were very rewarding and there was a lot of thought put into them and some times i was left stumped as to what to do next.   I loved the hunting for survival aspect of the game, even though i wouldn't have actually died if i didn't hunt, i still loved this aspect of the game. Perhaps next installment of Tomb Raider they could actually impliement that into the game. I personally hope they do. It's not like a Tomb Raider can put things on hold while they head on down to the store for some pizza and nachos.   The Skill and Salvage aspect of the game works very well indeed, i actually did look forward to earning a skill point or getting some salvage it added greatly to the immersiveness of the game. It also made searching every nook and cranny of the environment more of a need instead of a chore, and there was never a point in this game where i felt like i was doing something that felt like a chore. I enjoyed searching and rooting around environment, just in case i found something awesome that would help me or give me enough salvage to go upgrade one of my weapons.   From here on out, I'll certainly be riding on the Tomb Raider bandwagon, and looking forward to the next installment.  I hope they continue the story and in the meantime, I'll be going back to some of the older (graphically modern) Tomb Raiders.  I'm so glad this was on sale, otherwise i wouldn't have bothered with it thinking it was going to be like the old PS1 style, actionless and directionless puzzling platformer type gig. This game got me hooked on Tomb Raider!",1,0

219990,Grim Dawn,"This game is just what Diablo 3 should have been.   It's more of a predecessor of Diablo 2. It's dark, it's gothic.   Lots of items and skill variety and the to playthrough the story was a blast. It keeps you constantly going as your character develops and you just want another upgrade before logging out.   The only downside so far in my opinion is the Multiplayer mode.   I didnt had any crashes or the like, but you can basically compare it with Diablo 2 Open Battle Net. So its possibly to play with a cheated character and ♥♥♥♥ like that.

230410,Warframe,"This game isn't all bad. The gameplay resembles mass effect 3's multiplayer, as was said multiple times. Though what I do need to say is that the last thing this game will do is hold your hand and tell you what to do. I left the tutorial knowing how to run, do some of the parkour and some of the other basics. Though I had no idea of mods, getting materials and other things.  I mean, most of my success was from playing mass effect and using some common sense. Though I feel quite helpless without my friends, and i dont enjoy playing alone at all. I dont expect tobe told about everything, but the equipment part of the game is very confusing and very much turned me off. The leveling up (not affinity) requires you to be put in a, what I feel at least to be an extremely unnecessary and bland 'test'. You fight enemies in a computer generated landscape almost copypasted from assasins creed. They dont tell you anything about it, which feels quite weird.  The gameplay is pretty good, and although my military buff side of me doesn't like the impracticality of designs for characters and weapons that is not at all a complaint, because that's just opinion. The core gameplay is fun, but the grind and sheer scale of the game can be frustrating to overcome. I'd give this game a 5/10. (note this isn't gameinformer, 5/10 is average in my books)",-1,1

257350,Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition,"Quite simply the best game I have ever played in my 18+ years of playing video games. The world is so immersive, a seemingly endless stream of quests to complete, and so many classes that are all good that you want to play them all (except bard, screw bards). None of the classes are ragingly overpowered, even though mages can feel like it (specifically enemy mages) with time stops and imprisons galore, which just means that you have to be more strategic in spell placement as well as party composition.  Otherwise, there are tons of characters within the game, both companions and NPCs, that are quite interesting, including the ghosts, djinn, statues, etc. that will give you fun riddles. Maybe it's just because the Forgotten Realms world had it's lore well established long before Baldur's Gate became a thing, but whatever it is, this world is unlike anything I have ever experienced before, with little to no hand holding, yet it doesn't feel unfair. There is a strategy to get through everything, you just have to figure it out for yourself.  There are some bugs, but I found them mostly funny. High Watcher Oisig in the base game and a group of peasants in the expansion just kept randomly showing up in the most obscure places, and it was really funny to just see them pop up.  Best moment definitely goes to the part in Throne of Bhaal where a group of dark elves are disguised as random animals. I just wanted to slaughter a moose and, lo and behold, it was actually a drow. Go figure.  10/10 I'm glad I got to experience this for the first time through the Enhanced Edition on steam.",1,0

252450,StarDrive 2,"I regret buying this. I loved the first game. It was so close to being perfect, but it had some very game breaking problems that I feel could have and should have been fixed. Instead Zero left it broken and made this.  This is quite obviously unfinished. Lack of balance, basic UI bugs, crazy strong AI that loves to kill you a little too much and seems like it's cheating. At the very least, I'd wait a month or two for some patches.  Beyond the lack of polish, I feel, lies a game that is just inferior to the first. The turn-based systems lack the amount of control that the real-time systems did. For example, you can't reinforce your ships during combat, or position your forces around an enemy before attacking, or make any kind of hit and run moves. Just seems like it loses a lot and gains little, which I think sums everything up perfectly. Can't say i recommend it, and I wish I hadn't supported them.",-1,1

You have to LEARN how to be the hero, and that's awesome.  You have to be precise on the boss remixes and running through the dungeon can catch you off guard if you aren't fully attuned.

Glitchy mechanics. Copied package/assets. Copied concept and visuals. They're so desperate, that a month ago they put it on sale for 2 cents! Strategically that's good for them to be honest. Also, the sandbox mode is pretty much a literal sandbox and things like ammo and medkits spawn in it. What?!  I cannot recommend this game for anyone.

I play it on a PC with an Xbox 360 controller and it ran smoothly.   Overall, I would highly recommend the game. I really enjoyed it.

203750,Binary Domain,"I went into this game with fairly low expectations, thinking it was just going to be a middle of the road shooter with meh story. For the first half hour to and hour that's that I got, but after that the game took off and turned out to be quite the diamond in the rough.  The combat is your standard run and cover style where you're equipped with your primary assault rifle, a secondary (shot gun, sniper, etc.), pistol, and grenade type. This in it self isn't that great, but when you take into consideration you can dismantle enemies it becomes more interesting. If you shoot off their legs they crawl at you, blow off their arms they run in an kick you, snipe their head they become 'friendly' since they don't know who their shooting at anymore. This mechanic saves the meh combat system as you can do some interesting things with it. The boss battles are pretty bad though, often one-shoting you as your teammate just run around yelling at you and telling you where ammo is. The controlls are also a bit wonky, like middle mouse button reload, but it's not that bad once you understand it. But in all honesty you shouldn't buy this game for the combat, you should buy it for the story and characters.  Throughout the game you get introduced to more and more characters you can take with you in your squad during the chapters. You build, or lose, trust with them and can get several different endings to the game depending on this trust level. Nearly all of them are memorable, are well thought out, and amazingly voiced. The over all story had some good unforeseen plot twists as well, making me think it was over about three times before pulling another one out to keep the game going. This is defiantly what you should get the game for.  There is also the unique mechanic of voice recognition. Yep, you can talk to your NPC teammates. This is how you build that trust with your squad during battle and the interactive cut scenes. Did they get a sweet headshot? Praise them with a 'Nice!' or 'Sweet!'. Are they too far ahead? tell them to 'Regroup.' Do you want to confess you undying love for Big Bo? tell him 'Love You' of 'Looking Pretty Sweet'. That being said it can also backfire. I'm not sure if it was something in my set up, but it kept getting my voice lines wrong or not registering them all together. I'd try and tell my team to charge and someone thought I called them an 'Idiot' and just yelled at me and stopped following orders. I'm a streamer though so the audience, and I found it hilarious, this might be annoying for you.  Over all this is a really good game, a truly overlooked gem.",1,1

417990,,"My previous review was poorly worded and executed, so I thought I would simply write a new one that explains why I think that this game is absolutely garbage.  --  1.) The characters are flat. Character development goes nowhere. This point makes me livid, as characters are supposed to be the main focus of your story. They help with the mood, setting, plot, theme, I could go on... But if all your characters are flat, then I don't think your story is very good.  2.) The writing for the story is god awful.  3.) The trailer is deceptive. It includes phrases that promise for features like texting your 'friends', romancing people, and ultimately allowing you to have a huge effect on the plot. Here's a nut-buster, all of these aren't really features, or aren't in the game at all.  4.) The UI for the game is awful, especially for a game worth 10$. Not only does the UX fall behind because of how it looks (the GUI looks as though the game was made from the same engine that made free games like The Witch's House, except those games are better than this one), but it also is rather jarring how the text box jumps into the middle of the screen for player actions, which makes it seem as though the creator didn't think this through.  5.) This is the worst one. The creator of the game self-inserted himself into the plotline. Here's the kick in the balls you were expecting:  --SPOILER WARNING-- He's literally the most happy, creative, artistic, influential, friendly, famous, and ultimately most important person in the game. Once he dies, a ♥♥♥♥-ton of people literally break down into depression. It's naseating how he has the gall to do this. --IT'S FINE AFTER THIS LINE--  It just shows how the creator's mindset is like. Once people started to complain about his game, he literally started to yell back at people, whether or not it was constructive criticism.  6.) The plot is predictable, at least to me.  --  All in all, I wouldn't recommend this game, especially not at 10$.   I hope the creator can actually make better games than this in the future, and, once I read the reviews and pay attention to how people talk about it, I might buy it. But, right now, it seems unlikely that he can make a good game at all.  Hopefully he can prove me wrong.",-1,0

241560,The Crew,"Do I recomend this game? Yes, and no.  The story is boring and repetitive. The AI is way too easy, you win every race with minimal effort. You complete some section, then you move on to another section, where you do the same thing, with a different tuner. The difficulty doesnt go up. You move to a different place, you get another character you dont care about, everybody tries to look fierce, blah blah blah blah blah.   The police are too easy, and too hard at the same time. If they get you trapped for 3 seconds, even though you are clearly getting un-trapped, you get arrested. But if they didnt trap you, they barely stay on you. Seriously, it is way too easy to lose them.  But the multiplayer makes up for the terrible story. The summit events are always extremly fun, to try to get to silver and gold. The multiplayer races are extremly fun, but get boring fast, when you are playing the same maps. There isnt much different maps.   The side missions are also a blast. Freedriver stunts, crew missions, and something else, i cant remeber the name of it xD.   This is just kinda a freetime game. This game gets very stale, very fast. Beware.",1,0

The game is constantly being tweaked and the developers clearly care about giving the players the best experience they can provide.

Just like most of the other comments, the graphics aren't the best but it has something about it that makes you want to keep playing and you do get some satisfaction killing other players and bots its that enjoyable. I'm not going to beat around the bush that this game is perfect because it isn't, there are some minor issues that I have been experiencing and I'm not sure if other players are having the same but it doesnt affect gameplay too much, 1) Bullet travel in slow-motion doesn't always level with your cross-hair (if that makes sense?) 2) The game can lag quite a lot depending on the server or map location (the game isn't too demanding but can differ on certain computers) 3) The cross-hair itself needs a little tuning done to it as it feels kinda goofy (personal opinion) 4) Some of the players you might come across are children (to put it kindly). I know I have only played 2.7 hours at the moment, but its been 2.7 hours that has made me laugh due to the people I have been in servers with and the enjoyment factor is brilliant. I hope this review changes your mind if your not too sure about downloading it but all I will say is just give it a try and see if you like it.

332200,Axiom Verge,"It is a nice game made by someone who obviously knew NES games very well. The game painstakingly reproduces visual style of NES and SNES eras, and makes fun of some of the glithces that were found back when. it is obviously inspired by super metroid, although there were areas which looked like homages to titles like Altered Beast.   There are few issues with it, though:   It definitely needs a dash key. Dashing by double-tapping an analog stick is difficult.   Weapon quick selection is ... weird.   Loses momentum after first few hours and becomes quite a bit more boring.   Secrets are a bit too over the top and could be better designed. Some items apparently can only be found by repeatedly probing every wall you find and carefully investigating every part of a map. The strange part is that story can only be uncovered via finding secrets.   Some bosses near the end are cheap. (Bird bee boss, for example)   In short... it is a decent game, but Super Metroid was much more fun when I played it.  Still, for essentially a one-man product, it is damn impressive.  Worth checking out if you're into metroidvanias and retro styled games.",1,0

298900,Space Hulk: Deathwing,"I pre-ordered Deathwing the moment it came on Steam. Waited and waited. Played Beta. Loved it. Game Launch, and there are some serious game breaking bugs present. This was a little saddening. We got a patch, a week or so later, which fixed most of the major problems while creating some new ones.  That all said and done, Space Hulk: Deathwing is absolutely awesome. I'm a huge fan of WH40k and i've always loved Space Hulk. The turn-based virtual re-imagening of the board game by Full Control, was great. The little picture in a picture of what the terminators were seeing in first person had me begging for a First Person Shooter of the Space hulk universe. And boy does this game deliver that.   The Atmosphere is perfect. It is filled to the top and overflowing with WH40k theme and feel. No matter which direction you are facing, you will know you are in the WH40k universe and not some other space ship FPS. The detail put into the textures and the maps is just fantastic.   Though you'll rarely get a chance to stop and admire the beauty of it all, as breathing down your neck almost constantly is the Tyranid Swarm. And Swarm they are. They are fast, they are terrifying and absolutely lethal. You'll not get a moment to check out the beauty and work put into them either as you slay them, wave after relentless wave, with Bolter, Flame and Sword. Due to the player being a Deathwing Terminator, you do not move with the same speed as most other FPSs, so positioning and even the direction you are facing can mean the difference between you, or your squad, being wiped out.   Then there is all the little details. Once you have reduced a wave of Genestealers to nothing but corpses and bloody chunks, listen gleefully as your hulking Terminator's footsteps turn from a thudding stomp to a squelch and squishing noise of blood and guts beneath your boots.  The weapon sounds are awesome, playing with a sqaud of four the resounding noise of the bolters or assault cannons is music to any WH40k fans ears. One of these days a developer will come up with the fantastic idea to have weapon noises with its own sound adjustment in the options menu, so you can turn it up more!   There are lots of little lore and story scenes to be found around each map. making exploring rewarding, albeit dangerous.  Despite being a fast paced and epic FPSs, there is also a fantastic tactical element to the game. Closing and blocking doors behind you as you advance to slow the swarm down or create relative safe areas. There is a very 'Aliens' vibe to this game. One player working to close and lock a door as the other players struggle to hold back the swarm.  I really love this game. It has a few bugs, and more than just some people have had some pretty bad experiences with it. But for me, it is just fantastic. My only real problem with it, is it would be nicer if there were better wargear elements to it. Pick ups and or equipment, much like in the absolutely amazing Dawn of War II's Last Stand. So that you might have two Tactical Terminators that aren't identical. At the moment there are only 9 chapters, and 3 of those chapters will have you going back over some of the same maps. So i dare say, some DLC or expansions will add some more, and hopefully with some desired features that the fans have been asking for.  It's all these things that make for a great First person version of the board game. It is hard, it is brutal, it is fast, it is chaotic, it is epic and it is glorious!",1,0

The lore is some of ther best i've seen at this point and the voice acting gives character, personality, and emotions. The lore is more complicated than ever overall the games, but it is still fun, vauge and interseting to find and put together the pieces. The gameplay is more immersive than the past four, and has a great balance of visual and listening gameplay. It surprised me how much listening you had to do. It has element from the past four games, FNAF world, and The Silver Eyes, which helps solve the story even more. It has gamechanging easter eggs that really make us re-think the lore.

The dialogue could have been a bit more varried with some things you say leading to the same response. It was a bit predictible but the ending was still surprising. But as far as story the game was amazing, keeping you on the edge and nearly blind. Also as a plus the Graphics were simply stunning as long as your computer can handle them.",1,0

In a game like this, glitches as such, are unforgiveable because they really do take away hours of your time. During the epilogue, one of the puzzles weren't registering and I even had to look up a walkthrough. The walkthrough did the same as me but worked. I was stumped and spent hours redoing what I'd done over and over again... In the end during a bout of frustration, I reloaded the game and suddenly, the section I was trying to open opened up, however wasn't registering when I clicked the buttons. So I had to open and close that area for it register. I REALLY wish I could thumbs up the game but I just can't.. That's the first time I've been that frustrated from a game and it wasn't my own stupidy/lack of puzzle knowledge that caused it, if it was, this would have been a very big thumbs up :/.",-1,0

218620,PAYDAY 2,"This review has been changed from positive to negative after the most recent update from 'Crimefest'.  The game by itself is a good game, but these shady antics have officially made a good game turn bad by a shady company going back on previous comments.  At one point in time we were 'shamed' to think this game would ever incorporate microtransactions, now we are seeing them in what can only be described as 'CS:GO' style, by giving you safes like drops in CS:GO, where you have to pay almost 3 dollars of real money for a 'drill' which is essentially a key, to open the safe. This alone wouldn't be terrible as it just gives you a cosmetic skin, except that isn't really the case.  These above mentioned skins give you stat boosts along with being skins, which essentially turns a great game that was already borderline ridiculous with DLC that was accepted, into a game with lots of DLC now being greedy with microtransactions. It's sad to see a great game soiled with greedy producers, especially with a game that went far and beyond expectations with copies sold as well as DLC sold, so it is simple greed that has tarnished a great reputation with one swing.   If you don't mind pay 2 win in a game with tons of DLC already attached to it, then go for it. Yes this is a fun game, but in my opinion there is no place in a full priced game with lots of DLC to also include pay2win microtransactions.

CONS: -Improbable silly story. Koreans invading not only USA but many other countries? C'mon! -Campaign playtime is VERY short (3-5 hours top, depending of difficulty level) -Scripted like hell. Lots of enemies running at you until you kill that specific RPG soldier so they stop spawning! -Lots of 'invisible walls'... and door blocking lockers until lifted up by NPC. -Your running speed is like my grandpa walking speed. -Collectibles are annoying to search as your prompted from NPC's to carry on and move on to next objective.  OVERALL: That is about all that come's to mind for now and if you are slightly interested in Homefront, buy it only at a decent deal. Besides, there are plenty of wargames alternatives.

Maybe it's because the story setting is similar to real life ? Or maybe it's the awesome voice acting that makes you sit on the edge of your seat when you're about to make a major decision.

235540,Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide,"  Played the game during a free weekend FYI.  Honestly, this game was fun but i cannot recommend this game at its current price of $30 (even the on sale price of $15 isn't worth it without friends.)  This game feels a rip-off of a few other games (Left 4 Dead and Payday 2 to name a few). It attempts to copy what made those games great but falls short. The few things it was somewhat innovative in (the ratling gunner and the atmosphere) were well done, but those alone don't justify the price tag. It feels more like you're paying $30 for a tech demo, as the graphics are undeniably beautiful, and even those will grow old. While this game is pretty, there are numerous bugs which should be fixed pronto.  To list my issues, I will first say the 'campaigns' are inconsistent. They are usually too short, as they either end before they get good, or are unable to keep up a good pace once they do grow to be fun. Unlike Left 4 Dead, it feels more like quantity won out over quality. Mods would be very good for this game as it will grow old to anyone who's played every level, which can definitely be done within an afternoon (which is what i did). The weapons and rng are annoyingly imbalanced. Each character is limited by what weapons they could wield, so each time you complete a mission and get a weapon, more than likely you won't even get something you can use on your preferred character. Despite the trinket and updates promising better rng, it still screws over the players.   To finish up, I believe the game is good, but nowhere near the worth of its price, and that will not change unless they provide more content or allow the playerbase to create their own content. This game's players tend to die out over short periods of time (because it grows boring fast), so don't bother purchasing this game at full price until changes are made or with a group of friends when it's on a good sale (50% or more off).",-1,0

I did hear very postive reports from people I knew about this game and they weren't wrong at all as I found out. First off, It is a free to play title but it's free to play model is very nice but it doesn't really reward you for paying that much, more of a supporting the devs style of microtransactions.  I recommend playing on a standard server for the first 20 levels until you get the hang of it since it can be quite a hard game at times and you don't want to lose your character on hardcore. I haven't played this game that much due to other games that I wanted to play.  The balance is nice and the community relative peaceful and nice for a free to play game since they do kinda hate people who like D3 but as long you don't mention that if you do like it, then you should do just fine.

329110,Gems of War,"A match 3 game with a nice little twist. You collect troop cards to build on and level up throughout the game, and it's the strength of your team that helps you win each match. You can join a guild and earn numerous rewards. There's a LOT of hours of game play in this game!  You have to earn gold to take part in things throughout the game, and I see numerous negative reviews complaining about how they have no gold to do things throughout the game. I don't understand...even as a casual player, I've earned more than enough gold to do just about anything that I want in the kingdom, and still have a cushion.  The game can be highly addictive, if you like match 3 games. It's not just a mindless match 3 game, either. You have to plan out your moves, otherwise you could end up in some serious trouble.  Of course, you have the option to purchase diamonds to buy special chests and other things in-game, but you can also purchase chests with gold and glory that you earn; although they're not as 'high class' as the diamond chests, they're pretty good nonetheless. Anything you need...except for the diamonds, of course...can be earned in numerous different ways throughout the course of the game.  The game play itself is a lot of fun. Depending on what sort of troop you're playing against, the game can go quickly, or it can be an intensive grind match that lasts and lasts. It's the grind matches that give you a serious sense of accomplishment in the game when you win one, which is something that you really don't find in other match 3 games.  Overall, I think this is an excellent game, and well worth a try for even the most serious match 3 game player!  (Review edited 11-24-2016 to add:)  The longer I play this game, the more I love it. The developers are constantly adding new things and making good changes to keep the game fresh and interesting.

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"Okay, so here's the thing: we all know that Evolve (and Turtle Rock by extension) ♥♥♥♥ed itself over on launch horrendously. They locked a lot of content that should have been in the game from the start behind paywalls on day 1 that should have been at the very least been passed out to players who prepurchased the game, if not just put in the ♥♥♥♥ing game for free. It is completely fair to leave the game for this reason, and to hold that massive and obvious mistake against Turtle Rock and never play this game or buy it ever.  BUT. AND A HUGE BUT. ( ay ;] )  The truth is that despite this insane PR suicide by Turtle Rock, the game is legitimately very fun and polished, and since returning to give it another shot I have enjoyed it quite a lot. After 2 full DLC packs of hunters and monsters, along with multiple map packs and game modes that were added free of charge (and even a couple hunter/monster variations), the game boasts a level of diversity that makes it very diverse and interesting from game to game. Also because map packs and game modes were put in for free, you can still play with just the base game and it works perfectly fine, no limits on matchmaking or anything like that.  If the CURRENT STATE of this game was the state of the game on launch, I garauntee that it would have exploded in popularity and would still be popular to this day, no question.   THAT BEING SAID, there is the obvious issue of the playerbase, which has dwindled significantly over time. Queues are difficult to find and full teams are rare at certain points during the day/night. There is a ranked mode that is pretty much superfluous because there's almost no chance you will ever get to utilize it properly with this few remaining players.  Now then, what does that mean for you, as someone reading this review? Well, right now, during the Winter 2015 sale, the base game along with the first seasons pass (4 extra hunters and 1 monster) costs just $16. The second seasons pass costs 12 (4 more hunters, 1 more monster). Personally, I think buying the 16 season 1pass/game package is well worth the money, if not just to give the game a try. It certainly behooves me to recommend the title to you, because i play myself, but Iwant to make it clear that even without obvious bias, I would styill recommend this game for this price to anyone who is intrigued by the idea of the game and wants to play.  In short, give it a shot while it is at a massive ♥♥♥♥ing discount, you will be surprised at how improved the game is, and the more people that end up playing, the better the community and game will get. Turtle Rock has mostly attoned for their sins, although begrudgingly, and we can't expect them to make it F2P because of consoles (filthy ♥♥♥♥ing casuals that they are).  ",1,1

349720,Audition Online,"Got the Steam version just so I could leave a review on this game.  Do I recommend this game? Yes and no. If you're looking for an OSU or a DDR clone then you're in the wrong place. Stop leaving negative reviews because it's not the gameplay you expected, that is unfair and childish. If you are looking for games similar to OSU, check out Touch Online.  And no I am not being paid 'in-game currency' to publish or write this review. This is all me.  I've been playing Audition Online on and off since the days of Nexon (roughly 2007) and the game has gone through some changes, both good and bad.  For starters: The Steam port is just awful, there is some notable lag spikes in the Steam version versus downloading the game directly from the Redbana website.  This is part of why new users were scared off, the other issue is the lack of noob friendly gameplay and rooms. The community is bad, it's awful, don't let anyone convince you otherwise. I've been banned from rooms for being too good, so I know the pain of getting banned over how you play the game.  The game is also full of non-English speakers, so there is a lot of language boundaries. Not to mention all of the locked and afk rooms. The game is dying, but not giving it a chance is helping it die faster. The thing that differs Audition from other rhythm based MMO's is its unique gameplay. It requires a steep learning curve, and that scares a lot of people off. Even back in the days when it was popular, it was scary, but at least noob servers were offered in those days. Redbana is partly responsible for the game's decline, but so are these negative reviews.  It is corrupt that they tried paying users for good reviews and it is sad that the community is trash, but no one here seems to be trying to fix the issues at hand. The negative reviews that say all the items in the game cost money are blatantly lying. Yes, some items in the game cost real money, but not all of the items. All MMO's have in-game purchases that are over-priced, get over it. I'm surprised many people dislike the graphics, if anything they're adorable. The game has a unique look to it. They never tried to be realistic like many other Korean kpop games. There is nothing else like Audition. The updates are little to none, and not all of the songs are popular, but they lack money. The sheer fact the game is still running is outstanding in on itself. The people behind Redbana have a certain love for it, if they didn't, it wouldn't still exist.   Audition IS a good game. It's fun. Every time I come back I get addicted again. It's challenging and it keeps players on their toes. The game should be reviewed based on its gameplay, and it has fantastic gameplay. There is no denying that. If for a moment you forgot the trash community, the in-game purchases, and lag spikes, you've got a great game.   RECAP:  Pros: * Character customization * Challenging gameplay * Cute graphics * Many modes * Lots of songs (This game is very friendly for YouTube gameplay videos, as many of the music is composed by Redbana) * Items do not affect how well someone plays, a non-paying user is just as good as a paying user  Cons: * Lack of updates * Corrupt GMs (game masters) * Unpopular songs * In-game purchases (NOT REQUIRED!) * Takes forever to level up * Unfriendly to newcomers * Toxic community  In the end, if you're looking for a challenging rhythm game, Audition Online is for you. If you're looking to make friends or play something similar to OSU, look elsewhere.",1,0

For those of you who do not know the history of this game it originally was in pre-release phase but due to the failure of that pre-release, Double Fine forced the game to be 'fully-released' early. Basically it's a completely unfinished game that is claimed to be fully finished, the games many features include: Very few room options with literally only one object for each room, research that does not allow you to discover any new exciting objects or rooms but instead gives you stat boosts! (Only 7 or so research techs are even available), incredible glitches that surpass all human understanding and that persist after game restarts! what fun!, In the end you'll have done all the game has to offer in about 30 minutes and then youll slowly fall into depression as you wonder why you shelled out 10 bucks for this when that same money could have been spent on steak fajitas at Chile's...trust me your money is better spent there....or at least on stanely parable....",-1,0

Every time I play it, I get frustrated, but I love basketball and 2K is the only option on the market (EA doesn't have any idea on what they are doing). The teammate AI run around aimlessly, the opposing CPU will make heavily contested shots 9 times out of 10, and player tendencies don't mean anything. Most of the issues I have with the game only pertain to the top two difficulties. PROS: - Runs smooth - Graphics are nice - It's basketball - Game modes are fun CONS: - Controller support is wack - CPU plays at an unrealistic level on higher difficulties  - Teammates don't make sense - 2K doesn't support the game, and each update made the game run worse - The servers are dead - Player animations are used on multiple people, and get stale - Running plays doesn't work well - The refs are biased in favor of the CPU - CPU disregards player tendencies   With that said I still play this game quite a bit, and if it was $10 or less I would recommend it, but with 2k17 almost out, there really isn't any point to pay the $60.

241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"I first bought this game on sale last year and I can successfully say that it was one of my best purchases of 2015. As an avid LoTR fan (I read the trilogy at least twice ever year and the Hobbit is read seasonally), I didn't have great expectations for this game. I expected it to cash in on Tolkien's saga and leave me with a copy of the Batman games. After all, it plays the same, and it has many of the same overall mechanics. Well, after the first 2 hours with Shadow of Mordor, all my doubts had been shattered. In that time, I had been killed by an orc captain within 5 minutes, watched him grow in power, trained for another 15, killed him once, saw him come back, and killed him another time for good measure, this time taking off his pretty little head so that his friends knew who was in control. In all my years of gaming, few games have dragged me into the meat of the game so soon (exculding the rather lengthy training ground/backstory) and punished me so hard for not taking my surroundings seriously.  Let's talk about the good things first. The setting is great. There's no doubt about it. Whether you're in the massive, dirty strongholds of Udun, or in the vast fisheries of Nurn, the game always feels right. Shadow of Mordor did Tolkien's world justice and my first 5 hours of the game were mainly spent sightseeing. Gameplay is also a relative strong point. All the mechanics within Shadow of Mordor are very well put together and I've encountered very few glitches during my time with it. While the glitches that I HAVE encountered always seem to lead to my death, they've been usually been acceptable considering that I was in what most people would consider a 'precarious' position (i.e. holding onto a cliff for dear life that would lead to certain death if I was to fall). The physics engine/free climbing feels like a polished, superhuman version of Assassin's Creed 3/4. It's generally well done, and if you're able to suspend your doubt for the sake of gameplay mechanics, it's actually quite good and extremely enjoyable. There are 3 main modes of attack. Combat, stealth, and ranged. All are well-balanced, but many people prefer to just ignore stealth and ranged to just focus on combat. In doing this, they miss my favroite way to play Shadow of Mordor: The unseen shadow. Sometimes stealth can feel a tad overpowered in Shadow of Mordor, but when you're in the midst of a packed stronghold, you'll be thankful that orcs can't see more than 3 feet in front of them (with almost no peripheral vision). While both stealth and ranged are good options to have, straight combat is easily the most developed style of dealing with your enemeies. While fighting slightly repetitive, it's extremely deep and has many ways to keep itself fresh. Perhaps the strongest point of the gameplay is how it progresses. As you advance in the story, you'll earn more skills, and eventually earn entire new ways to play. Some of these skills are story-bound, and that's not a bad thing as it manages to keep things fresh at both the game's highest and lowest points. The story, while forgettable to those who would rather focus on gameplay, is another piece that does the original works justice. Everything fits neatly into the LoTR universe and some of the attention to detail that the game's creators put into the glossary is staggering. Besides all that, without spoiling anything, everything within Shadow of Mordor fits so well into Tolkien's original works that I actually consider this game part of the story despite the fact that I know it's not canon. Overall, great setting, good progression, and an amazing use of the source work to create a believeable story.   The cons of this game are generally based on opinion. While I don't have many real complaints, I'm going to list a few that I've heard. First, the fighting is very repetitive and pretty easy in most circumstances if you decide to just go in as a sword wielding maniac. Most orcs are easy to cut through and even when you're surrounded by 30+ of them, there's no reason that you should get hurt if you've made it at least through the first few missions. The captains and warchiefs are much larger challenges that can actually kill you (and kill you FAST) if you're not careful. They require a much more tactical approach to removing and this jarring transition between 'easy, almost Dynasty-Warriors gameplay' and 'strategic chess match' can really throw people off. I much prefer facing off against more difficult opponents and the 'Dynasty Warriors' gameplay can get old quickly if that's the only way you play. Another general negative thing about Shadow of Mordor is the mid-point of the game. When you get about half-way through, the game starts to lose its charm for a few missions and it seems like objectives become both drab and boring. While this doesn't last long, it's enough to throw a lot of people off and impatient players may quit altogether before reaching the game's amazing conclusion.   Overall, Shadow of Mordor's variety and polish make it one of my favorite games that I played last year. While it lacks slightly in some areas, it does a ton of things correctly and makes for a great single-player experience. I'd rate it a solid 9.1/10. If it's on sale, get it and don't be afraid to purchase the DLC too. Both the Lord of the Hunt and Bright Lord campaigns are incredibly good in their own right and are easily worth the price tag (Bright Lord easily being my favorite DLC for any game in a long time). While Shadow of Mordor isn't for everyone (especially if you didn't enjoy the Batman titles), this hardcore Tolkien fan is satisfied to know that there's at least one good game out there featuring my favorite fantasy world.  Buy if on sale.",1,0

322330,Don't Starve Together,"Almost too addictive.   In short: you (and friends) gather resources in a large randomly generated world to survive for as long as you can. You'll need food, and gear suited to surviving the harsh elements and attacks from evil creatures.   The first few playthroughs are going to be hard, but do yourself a favor and try not to look up walkthroughs or tutorials. A lot of the joy of this game comes from exploring and experimentation.   What keeps the game fresh is replaying in different worlds with unique setups, and random encounters. My biggest problem with Don't Starve is that there isn't really a strong end goal to justify the number of hours you'll sink into this game. You basically play until you get bored, but (at least for me) it's hard to get bored of this game, so you just keep playing and playing until a week has passed, your girlfriend has left you, your houseplants are all dead, and you're fired from your job.",1,0

207210,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD,"They updated the graphics but downgraded the gameplay. The original THPS2 gameplay felt way better than this HD remakes gameplay. E.g. they somehow couldn't get proper nollie flips done. Basically you do a nollie but then the flip animation is the one of a regular flip trick. Although I undestand that this issue isn't noticable or bothering for many players, to me it is a major flaw. Especially if you consider that THPS2 already did its flip trick animations perfectly fine 12 years before this remake was made. I would choose playing the old graphics with the old gameplay of THPS2 over the ones of the remake any time. Summarizing my experience with THPS HD, I can't say it was worth the time. To me it is nothing but a pretty lazy remake and an even lazier try to cash in on the good name of the old THPS titles.",-1,1

Right away I didn't like the music (each level area has a randomized track set, hit and miss) and thought some of the character animations were really awkward. I was pretty quick to dissmiss the game and had a bad taste in my mouth from what in my opinion was an over priced arcade game, but I came back to it a few days later and got hooked. I was able to look past some of the flaws I didn't care for in the game and was able to enjoy it for what it is, a brutal, unforgving yet rewarding platformer.  My only complaint about the game is the unlockable characters, I love the idea of course, but just wish they had some context, seemed like a bunch of random characters with silly outfits, I like the robot, but thats just me.",1,0

298110,Far Cry 4,"I'm gonna begin this review in the same way I begin all my Far Cry reviews - by talking about Far Cry 2.   Far Cry 2 was not a perfect game. It's story was very limited, and thus the context and motivation for your actions were lacking. It's saddled with a number of half-implemented mechanics, and fully-implemented but frustrating and repetitive mecahnics. However, it was laden with an incredible atmosphere, a genuinely reactive world, and (most amazingly) the landscape of the game felt real, not built. You felt like you were actually watching the setting African sun filtering through the dust and the trees as it fell over the still river water at dusk. It's a mental image that I cannot forget.  Now there's a few reasons I bring up FC2. A lot of people don't enjoy it. and I get that. It can be frustrating and it's not the most accessible or guided experience. BUT, what it does do is it plops the player in a big sandbox, gives them limited resources and intelligent and dangerous enemies, and says 'make your own story'. And because the game refuses to spoon-feed the player, and in that need for the player to adapt to the changing circumstances around them, FC2 allowed a constant creation of 'this one time when I was playing Far Cry 2...' moments. It aschewed OTT collect-a-thon busywork. It aschewed the asinine tower-climbing that has become that crumbling pillar upon which Ubisoft's games stand. It gave the player a bunch of rather vague mission parameters, a jungle, some fire, some deadly enemies, and a bunch of fairly underpowered weapons and said 'good luck'. And it was exhilirating. It was exhilirating to be forced into a cat-and-mouse stealth battle with a number of men whose clothes matched the surroundings. I was exhilirating to be unable to flush them out of hiding because you were in green grass and green grass won't burn. It was exhilirating to have to use your hearing to locate enemies because you're under a canopy and it's too dark to see them. It was exhilirating having to turn your eyes away from the road to look at your map only to look back at the road and see an enemy vehicle coming your way, knowing that if you don't get to your gun fast enough that you might die. It tested your skills as a player. It forced you to focus and made a man out of those that took the gunplay for granted.   Then came FC3. And all of a sudden the HUD was filled with markers and minimaps and text, and you could see enemies through walls, and the map was littered with garbage that you had to collect or else you wouldn't get the achievement that said you collected all the garbage, and the entire map was the same and recognising your location by it's appearance was all but impossible (but that didn't matter because you had GPS to hold your hand), and the enemies all wore the same bright primary colour because there's nothing more tactical than making yourselves visible from the moon, and once you cleared an enemy stronghold they were gone for good and you'd effectively progressed by making the map less fun. Hurrah?  I was excited for Far Cry 3. I lined up to play a pre-release build at a video game convention, and I bought it and played it and finished it and it was okay. And then a few years later I got a better graphics card and I reinstalled it, and I uninstalled it again within 2 hours because once you've finished it, going back is like returning to the second grade.   And then Far Cry 4 was released. And I didn't get it. Because it was more of the same, wasn't it? Because I was bored by FC3 and the obnoxious characters and the obnoxious hand-holding. For the record, I suck at Dark Souls - I'm not the world's best player and I don't relish a punishing experience - but the 'winning formula' that Ubisoft had struck upon with FC3 failed to capture my imagination. I didn't hate it. I still remember the first time I played it through. But the gameplay failed to challenge, and the story failed to engage, so the game itself failed to give me a reason to return. But I love the series because of its potential. Because even when it was Crytek property I loved the conceit - an open-world (of sorts) FPS sandbox in an exotic locale. I loved that at one point Ubi had created a set of reactive mechanics that, together, created an experience that was greater than the sum of it's parts. So I bought FC4 (on sale of course). And...it was fun. At least, the first play through was fun. The hand-holding wasn't as obnoxious, the game looked better than FC3, the characters still grated, but the story wasn't COMPLETELY devoid of heart. The game was still using collectibles as a substitute for meaningful content, but at least those collectibles unlocked weapons for you to use. The game was full of predators that add a degree of unpredictability to the game that I felt was severely lacking in the 3rd installment, and your plans for stealth can often go awry when a stroppy leopard stumbles into the mix. The enemy strongholds can be reset, or contested, which means that danger is never ENTIRELY eliminated from the equation. It's a better game. It's fun.   Upon replaying you can fly over the land and see how uniform it really is. Lacking still is variety in the terrain. The landscape is little but a bunch of locations connected by a series of roads, with nothing much that stands out in between. This place is not lived in, it's not real. It's a 2D game board on a table with a carboard prop every 5 squares, and a bunch of plastic army men stationed here and there. The enemies are still painted day-glo, just in case you forget where to shoot, and most of the missions involve going somewhere, killing something, and/or collecting something else. There's a re-hash of the FC3 mission in which you can burn a bunch of plants, and there's a single contemporary song in there somewhere, because feelings are like cold hard numbers, and Ubisoft have a steadfast belief in the simple arithmatic formula of 2 x (memorable moment) = 2 memorable moments. There's also a bunch of side-missions that involve taking drugs, because that was a thing they did in a different game that people bought.   But...it's fun. It easy to pick up and play and you're rarely far from a firefight. There's enough unpredictability to make it feel a little different each time you log on (because UPlay). It's got a little more lustre in it than FC3 the second time round. It's no FC2, and it's still adhering strictly to Ubisoft's slogan of 'video game, the video game', but it's almost, ALMOST, a compromise between the accessibility of FC3 and the dynamic engagements of FC2.   It's not a bad game. It's not a game-changer, but did you expect that? Get it cheap.",1,0

But with this game I was never frustrated ever. The controls are very tight and very fluid. The challenges aren't frustrated at all, its not like some platformers where if you are off by a micrometer you die, instead it feels a lot more natural and flowing, while still being very challenging in a fun way.   This game is also extremely well paced. Doesn't feel like you are wasting time ever. Instead its a constant stream of fun with enough variance and inbetween to keep you going forever.   I don't bother reviewing most games, mostly because I always think they suck but this one is just that good.   Its better than: Super Meat Boy, Electric Super Joy, and other platformers in the genre. You can tell as you play it that the creator is 100% a genius. A true genius.",1,0

This game is horrible, everthing about it is horrible. The sound is very repetitve and sounds muffled. The sound effects sound like they came from a non-copyrighted free effects site. The visual are just plain bad even for a 360 game. This game also has almost no tutorial, so you have to find out everything yourself. This to-date is Creative Assembly's WORST GAME I have ever played. Do not buy this game, unless it is on sale for less than 2$",-1,0

303210,The Beginner's Guide,"It can often times be very difficult to give a binary recommendation of games, yes I recommend this game or no I do not. The Beginner's Guide is a definite example of this, ultimately I do recommend it but caveats apply. I will explain why but I will not say much of anything about the actual game.  The main thing I will say is if you are looking for a game that will provide 100 hours plus of gameplay, this is not your game. If you are looking for a new experience or maybe you want to be left thinking and perhaps even inspired then you may wish to experience this relatively short but intriguing game.   At only an hour and 45 minute, give or take, there is not much to the game as far as hours to dollar but you may value more then hours played as in you may value your overall experience more, if so then I can recommend the game to you. Otherwise go get any other number of open world games that can provide 100's of hours of gameplay, if you are tired of those or just want something completely different then give The Beginner's Guide a try, it is the cost of a coffee and a donut so though short you could do much worse for your investment.",1,0
239820,Game Dev Tycoon,"Game Dev Tycoon puts you in the role of a budding video game designer at the dawn of the PC revolution, and takes you well into the theoretical future of the industry.  While a simple game at heart, Game Dev Tycoon offers a surprising amount of depth as you experiment in how to create the perfect game. Different genres need more focus in certain elements, along with a carefully crafted balance of design and technology. Topics such as Fantasy can appeal to every age, while only the youngest gamers are drawn to games about Virtual Pets. Finding the mix of genre, topic, and design elements that lead to an industry-defining game design takes a lot of trial and error, but the rewards are worth it--assuming you don't go bankrupt first, a real concern as you struggle to balance training your staff to produce better games between actually releasing new titles to generate income.  Game Dev Tycoon's clean interface and simple but well-defined graphics contribute to an overall rather pleasant experience where you never really have to wonder what's going on. The only negative things I can really comment on here are that things like game reviews and convention screens can be mildly annoying to sit through, and that the development screen doesn't give hard numbers on how much time you're dedicating to each area of a game's design. Otherwise things run quite smoothly and it's always easy to find exactly the option you're looking for.  If you like business simulation games (a combination that does quite well inside of the game itself!), Game Dev Tycoon is a simple but very pleasant example. Even if they aren't normally your thing, it's possible any gamer might enjoy a small look inside the world of game development.",1,0

The Art style is incredible, the escalation of problems is excellent, and the events are incredibly detailed. However, the events seem to be incredibly disconnected from one another, with no issue or resolution playing a role in your story later aside from morality.  I also believe the game isn't actually finished yet.   Spoiler below:  Upon reaching reaching the throne room and running through the dialouge, the Prince's transformation was described, but not shown. Instead, a blue screen with the logo on the bottom appeared. I quit, reloaded, and the new, transformed image was up. But then, three turns into the fight, it jumped to another blue screen with the writing 'insult_throneroom_3' or something along those lines, then ended my game.",-1,0

236090,Dust: An Elysian Tail,"Dust: An Elysian Tail is a RPG Hack and Slash indie game created by Dean Dodrill. The game sets place on the land of Falana, a world inhabited by anthromorphic animals. While some people may find the character style odd, I in the other hand love it, as it's much more different, compared to other games similar.  The game's art AND mechanics are made by the game's author himself, which is a big bonus, for a indie game too. Personally, the game is a tad bit underrated, I guess. More people should try the game out, and experience it themselves!  The art of the game is stunning, especially when using full resolution, and having a quality screen for your PC. The art stays beautiful, even to the end of the game without rushed art, as you'll be adventuring in sprawling magical forests, and grim graveyards, and the soundtrack fits the game perfectly too!  Conversations in the game happens by having the both characters on the other sides of the screen, and having text AND voice conversation at the same time. The voice acting may feel a bit too cheesy sometimes, but it's very well done, and the voices fit the characters so well too! The character art is very well made too!  The game's mechanics are simple and easy to get used to, but still brilliant. The game has some chain attacks to use with easy commands. The friendly NPCs are almost all in one village, where they give quests for you. You can't interact with them too much, but it doesn't make the game worse though. There's almost only enemies outside the main village, apart from special occasions, like quests.   The game doesn't have much for customizing though, for example; New suits or skins. It's a slight shame that you can't really change anything visually for Dust. The game runs with a slower computer too, like my laptop that I use to play the game with, and the FPS is very good in the game.  The story of the game is very gripping experience, and not just a gliché RPG plot, but a story that has good twists and emotional parts, that MAY have gotten me to have a few manly tears now and then...  In overall, Dust is a very unique experience, with a good story, and art! The game's longevity reaches up to almost 30 hours, if you're going to complete the game 100%, as there is many side quests to complete! The game needs to more attention, as I strongly support indie developers myself too. I'm hoping that the game gets a sequel some day badly, as it leaves you wanting for more! 10/10",1,0

365890,Heroes of Normandie,"If you love the combination of modifiers and dice rolls of table top gaming you will be in orgiastic nirvana with the most beautiful women when playing HEROES OF NORMANDIE.  Playing HoN reminded me of when i used to play games like Napoleon At Waterloo, Battletech, Cyborg Commandos etc where doing things like moving troops into different degrees of wooded terrain would make them harder to hit as well as increase their survival chances on the battlefield. If your caught out in the open you will be a very easy kill depending on what has found its sights on you and the range of its weapons. Battlefield wreckage will also block field of view making it harder to hit a target but you can fire on the wreckage and if your dice roll does enough of damage you will have a clear path and view. Going up against vehicles and tanks can be rather tricky. I was quite surprised how maneuverable they were on such a small map giving them a sense of realism as they were anything but easy targets for my bazooka infantry and armor units.   Movement and combat is done by giving orders to units which they will carry out when pressing the proceed button. During combat you can select individual weapons to fire depending if they are in range. Clicking on them will give you their strengths and what their main purpose in combat is such as suppression or just out right destroying the enemy.   During the supply phase you can move units that were not previously given orders since you are limited to the amount of orders you can give each turn. These units cannot fire. You also have a Bluff order during the orders phase which is a fake move or lie.  Graphics are amazing capturing the tabletop look perfectly with square chits covered in unit stats and great looking art work of the many different unit types. Terrain is displayed gorgeously and right clicking on it and units will bring up important information such as defensive bonuses. Infantry bleed a gushing red and tanks explode violently reminding me of those old mail order wargame ads in the back of comic books which came with tanks you could attach rubberbands to so they would explode in half on the plastic maps they also came with.   There are also plenty of comical visuals with commanders and officers cracking jokes during mission preps along with pleny of sexy female officers giving that inspiring spark to fight on! HEROES OF NORMANDIE definitely captures the brighter side of combat not done in most strategy games with its heroic imagery while still feeling like serious fun.  Sound effects and music come together as a explosive union of audio majesty as thundering tank fire from cannons shake the battlefield with shattering might and infantry rifle fire goes zigging across tree lines to hit their targets. The sound of tank treads can be heard crushing the ground leaving a trail of defiled landscapes. The rolling of dice fills the air with thrilling anticipation of a hit or miss.   HEROES OF NORMANDIE the complete package of tabletop gaming glory! The only thing missing is the smell of napalm.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"Payday 2. It used to be my FAVORITE game. Of course, that was a couple years ago. I played all throughout the Beta of this game (The month) and then till Imfamy came out. It was SPECTACULAR back then. I come back and things are so... different. I get a totally different feel from the game once I play. I remember people ALWAYS doing stelth on missions where it mattered more but I see a LOT less of that because of all these new weapons. That's amazing and all, sure, hell, I didn't even like to Stealth much but I understood the apeal. I come back to people running around with poison weapons, where bashing people with your gun isn't a thing, attachments are insane now and plenty are worthless, again, these poison weapons and flame weapons make it to where you REALLY don't need too much of anything else. Sheilds? Molatov! Path blocked off? Blow em up. That's fun and all but it feels lacking of what the first game used to have. I love the harder modes. Overkill is easy but Deathwish is just that usually. Visuals are good but I just think that it could be better optimized. the movements feels slugish at times and armor seems unbalenced. Pistols are broken as many people say and they have micro transactiosn. &lt;-- That's messed up. Other than that, I enjoy the game. It's a lot of fun to run around and, well, get to your Payday! Would I recomend it? I honestly couldn't bring myself to do that because of how little I've played in the past month of me coming back. Again, I don't know very much about all the new stuff but it has a different feel I don't like. Seeing the newer reviews and how the ratings for this game have gone down is pretty upsetting. It's sad really to see this happen.  It matters how the game is. The game has gotten worse since the beginning. It actually felt good after it came out! The gameplay was new, smooth, and an upgrade. There werren't overly useless weapons like there are now so you actually could see 'Oh, ok! This weapon is better!' rather than having all these random weapons and only having a couple that are actualy viable per class, leaving the other half of weapons to be confused by new or returning players to where they get them, fail, and you feel like you're doing worse or it's jsut stupidly hard because there's no guidence. There's no 'This is basically what you use at a higher level'. Going in heavy is basically pointless in Deathwish now. I mean, it was easy when it came out but now the game feels clunky, and sort of laggy in a way and I'm getting 90 FPS continuously. I remember when it ran much better than this and it's dissapointing.  The game developers haven't even opologised about there mistakes. LEt's take a look at other game devs. LEague of Legends just recently posted about how thye want to listen to the community. Here, I'll quote it.   http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/editorial/champion-update-and-flawed-fencer  ''For ChampUp, success isn’t measured by the quality standards set by artists or designers. Says Rhee, “Fiora’s update shouldn’t be judged by ‘What did we want to make, and did we make it?’ It’s measured by, ‘How do players feel about this? Do players love this change? We try to surprise and to do things players don’t expect, but that end goal is always present.” The objective quality of art assets or VFX are a lower priority than whether those elements reflect player passion for a given champion. A miss is a miss, regardless of its technical execution.''  This is BEAUTIFUL. Seeing developers admit they were wrong in some sort of way and to explain exactly why they did it.  The conversation between the devs and moderators for Payday 2 got NOTHING done. The questioning was poorly exicuted, it was repetative, and Almir avoided giving some sort of strait answer. He's the community manager (some other, better word for that would be nice), isn't he? If he can't handle his own mods telling him off in a poorly exicuted way, I don't think he should be any sort of head, now should he? He couldn't answer easy questions that people could figure out anyways. I thought of many, legal ways he could have counteracted things AS IT WAS GOING ON. That's fairly sad. No, that's sickening. As one of the moderators said for the problems 'It shouldn't have happened in the first place'over and over and over again.... It was painful to listen to her say that without any real script. Just repeating most of the same words for 5 minutes, acomplishing minimal anything.  Yes, a lot of my grammar and spelling is bad but I don't really care. If you can understand it and correct it in your head, than I've done ok, yeah? If not, do point out where these are and I'll go along and fix them. If it's to improve, it's fine.  Mmmm, there's a LOT I could say. Like how I loved the game when it first came out and expolain in depth why but I'm not sure I should have to. The game's Steam Community rating is at 65% curently (75%?). That's just sad. SAD. Can't wait till the game says mixed ratings. Maybe THEN the des will fess up and they might just get an upvote for finally saying something after being tourtered from this. Sure, they have money. But I hope there isn't a Payday 3. I can't immagine what type of terrible shooter that'd be. Yeh",-1,0

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"It's tough to write a review for this game. It is fun. It has a great story line that I have fallen in love with. It keeps me playing. multiple story lines that sort of connect and some that don't. Still great story telling. And maybe that is where I find my problems. Don't get me wrong, the game is great. The graphics, game play, audio, fighting, etc. Most of it is great. There is one place I find fault. Some background, I've played every game calling itself an rpg. I'm not sure I would call it an rpg. Sure you are role playing but you have one role to play and that is the main character. You carry some swords and bombs and potions. But you are pingeon holed into the character you play. This game is not really an rpg and more an action adventure with amazing story telling. Quests are very unique and very compelling to follow. Even the side quests are compelling enough to stick with them and play through. But there is no actual role playing. You don't create a character of your choice and do your own thing. The world is open but really only to persue a different quest line or story line. You don't get to actually do anything outside the stories presented to you. That's not bad but it makes for a horrible rpg.  It is hard to pin point what disappoints me about whitcher. Believe me, what does leave an empty hole with the game is nothing big. The game is great. I love a lot of it but it is missing the actual rpg aspect. I can't start the game and go, 'well this time I want to be a elf mage' or 'this time I am going to steal everything in sight.' Really it is the minute things that you do that have no impact at all that irk me a little. I can walk into any home and loot the place with the owners there and nothing happens but that I get a lot of loot. The people, the world, are kinda devoid of interaction. The game has specific things that it wants you to interact with and anything outside those things and you get a cookie cutter response. most town folk give you some random saying if you try and talk. Many objects are just for looks. The world lacks actual interaction outside the game mechanics.   The game is great, but I imagine, once I have finished the main story line, and maybe visiting other dlc story lines, outside that there isn't much replayability. I guess I could focus on building my character differently and focus on spells rather than fighting or focus on potions or whatever, but it's all to the same means. There is really no reason to most of the lines of character building other than to advance the story line. The faster you kill the faster the story line advances and specing in fighting seems to progress the story line further.   The story telling is advanced and your choices to have an affect on how the game plays out. But honestly this is just one of those books where you pick an option and turn to a specific page to see how the story pans out, except you have decent animated graphics to join it. Haven't beat the game yet, but my review stands as I have experienced all the mechanics and gameplay. It is a rinse and repeat of gameplay. Only the story builds up. I know the story will be awesome and that is worth the game but after I have reveealed the story and played it through, there won't be much left to do. There is no, 'well I played as a elf thief and have backstabed everything to death, now lets do it as a wizard.' developing the main character any different won't change much except how battles play out or how the story progresses. I guess that is my qualm, no matter how you develop your character, the story plays the same. Whereas say, in skyrim, how I develop my character changes the quests I do...actual freedom based on how I decide to play.   Still, the game is great and far worth the money, but to me, not goty quality. just my opinion.",1,0

Remains to be seen how mechanis work in the long run. Especially elevator strategies.  IN ADDITION:  Played some hours by now. And still like it, but:  * A real letdown is that elevaters and stairs have to be placed next to other structures. Sim Tower from the 1990s allowed them to be placed in front of them, adding a third dimension. Also, no escalators, as it seems.  * Different from Sim Tower this game is not so much about elevator management, but about ressource and pipe / line management. You only have a limited supply of energy, water at one time. And you always need to plan ahead of the needs of your tenants.  * Take your time. It's a slooow game. You may (and will) hurry game speed, especially during the night.",1,1

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is an MMORPG. The rebooted/revamped version of the atrocious Final Fantasy XIV, and the 100th billionth game in the Final Fantasy franchise.   FFXIV:ARR is much like what WoW used to be when WoW was good. They took much of what made WoW great back in vanilla/The Burning Crusade and used it to shape FFXIV:ARR, adding a modern touch on top.   After the failure of Final Fantasy XIV, Square Enix got rid of most of the development team and learnt from their mistakes. What they've ended up with is an amazing MMO with tons of content and fine details to keep you playing for months.   The game offers a unique class system much like FFXI, where you're free to change your class at any time you wish, by simply changing your weapon to that of the class you wish to equip. There's 9 classes to choose from, with each playing a different role: tanks, healers, and DPS's. Each of these classes later turn into jobs, offering more abilities for you to gain and unlock. There's also 8 crafting classes, and 3 gathering classes available.   The game is filled with various dungeons, raids, and trials which are essentially boss fights.   Many MMOs lack true end game content, however FFXIV:ARR is mostly focused on end game content. Many consider the game to not start until you reach level 50 (which takes anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, depending on how you play and how often you play). The game offers many dungeons for leveling, and even more for late game. Many of which are harder versions of leveling dungeons. On top of this, there's multiple raids ranging from your traditional raids with many players (24 in this case), or smaller 8 player raids. Finally, for those who love boss fights there's plenty of trials to keep you entertained. These are mostly primal fights with varying levels of difficulty.   There's tons of gear in the game each offering unique looks, allowing for huge amounts of customisation. In terms of character customisation, there’s quite a few options for you to choose from. There’s 5 different races, with each offering two sub-races of sorts. For example, your traditional “human” race has both midlanders and highlanders. The game does not offer sliders for things such as eye shape, nose shape, etc., but instead has four different types for you to select, with each sub-race having a different selection. As well as this, there’s plenty of hairstyles for you to choose from, with a wide range of colours to select as well as a highlight colour.   The game’s OST is absolutely amazing, and possibly one of the best I’ve ever heard in a game. There’s tons of tracks with unique songs for each field location, dungeon, trial, raid, and everything else.   I highly recommend checking it out, even if you do not purchase the game.    The game is updated every couple of months adding more items, dungeons, primal fights, new music, and much more. So there’s always plenty to do.   FFXIV:ARR is subscription based. You can pay $12/month for 1 character per world, with a maximum of 8 characters. Or you can pay $15/month for 8 characters per world, with a maximum of 42 characters. Though with the way classes work, you won’t be needing more than a single character usually, so the limit is hardly an issue. Some people are turned off by subscription fees, however $12/month is a small price to pay for such a great game, which constantly gets more content. The lack of F2P or B2P also prevents P2W aspects, and usually means the community is better in general.   Overall, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn has to be the best MMORPG I’ve ever played. The sheer amount of content has kept me hooked for over 400 hours, and will continue to do so as the months go on. If you’re looking for a great MMORPG to play, and have the money to invest, I could not recommend this more.",1,1

289930,TransOcean: The Shipping Company,"TransOcean is a pretty cool and fun game where you just run your own maritime shipping company and you can run as many ships that you can afford. The ships range from a tiny freighter to a Panamax to a UCLV (a really big ship) and you can ship goods from ore to counterfeit goods to weapons to and from countries in the world.   Gameplay wise, it's pretty simple and there is a mini game where you can dock and cast off. It does get repetitive after a while but if you play the game in bursts, it's fun. There are challenges where you can accept company contracts to ship a certain number of goods from one port to another in a certain time frame, which is rewarding in the end. There are also random events that pop up where you decide to avoid it or go through it, as well as customs checks from time to time (often on Hard difficulty). One neat feature I love about the game is there is online connectivity where players who play this game effect prices of goods if a port is visited often.  However, what I do find is that when you start expanding, the amount of ships that you have to manage gets overwhelming and I wish there was a way to easily load your freighters at multiple ports.  Overall, I do recommend this game but remember to play it in bursts or it will get repeititive. Score wise, about a 8/10.",1,0

I remember when I played this game the first time, I was shocked by its brilliant FPS effects at the beginning, but disappointed soon due to the lack of strategy depth.

282760,Circuits,"I'm not a connoisseur of music. I mostly listen to soundtracks, using them as an auditory trigger to try and relive the resonant moments that I felt when watching a movie or playing a video game. Sometimes I close my eyes and try to unravel the music. I don't claim to do so with any expertise; but there are minor revelations, and then I marvel at the composer's expertise and imagination at constructing the end result.  Circuits is a puzzle game that peels the curtain back a bit further. The concept is simple: you are given auditory snippets which you must arrange in the correct manner in order to reproduce a song. There are up to three layers in a song, and (prior to the last two levels) the game allows you to listen to each layer individually - a fascinating insight into the mind of a composer.  There are additional puzzle elements - switches, loops, extraneous sound bites - but Circuits introduces each complication gently, and removes them before they overstay their welcome. This restraint in puzzle design helps ensure that the experience never grows stale.  ---- Pbbt ----  Once upon a time there was a boy who could only make one sound. No matter what he did - how he shaped his lips or moved his tongue or pressed air through his teeth - that single sound was the only one that would ever emerge. Which sound was this? Stick your tongue between your lips, press down, and blow. Yep, that's the one.  Still, this was not the worst affliction in the world, or so the boy's parents told themselves. They enrolled the boy in a school for the deaf, where he learned to use his hands to sign his thoughts to others. It was a hardship of course, but one that the human race at large understood and even sympathized with. And so the boy grew up into a man who did not dread the greater world. Instead he faced it with a straight back, a strong heart, and a grin on his face.  Until the fateful day when he heard the last movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony  (link) . In his mind the voices wove a glittering fabric, rising and falling strands of color and exaltation that created a single Ode to Joy. The man listened to Beethoven's masterpiece again, and then again, and then again and again, and there was a moment when he realized that he was both lost and in love, and perhaps the two were not so different? Yes: the man was both lost and in love, and not knowing where he was, there was nowhere else he would rather be.  That day a path was created for the man, clear and straight and true. He would become a singer. Not a great one, of course - the man was not delusional - but perhaps if he studied and trained enough, he would be rewarded with a small place in a great choir. And then one day his voice would be added to the song he adored.  It was not to be.  I will spare you the details of the man's tragedy, give you but a clouded view of the moment when the man realized that his body had betrayed him from birth, that his hopes were cobwebs and his dreams but mud. On that day the man sat alone on a park bench and cried. He did his best not to, knowing that in doing so he would only bleat out his cursed sound over and over and over again. But his sorrow was too great; it pounded against the dam of his soul and would not be denied.  There was laughter.  Who would be so thoughtless? Who could be so cruel? The man peeked out from between his fingers with red-rimmed eyes, only to discover a face that was thoughtless, but not cruel.  'Mister,' the little girl said, still laughing. 'That's really funny. Can you do that again?'  That day the man discovered a new path for himself, a future that would be filled with joyful children. And, he reflected, was that not an even greater blessing than the one he had originally desired for himself? ----------------------------  On a personal note, the music in Circuits - synthesized voices and electronica - does not hold the greatest appeal for me. What would I prefer? Something like Mozart's deathbed scene from 'Amadeus'  (link)  (forward to 2:00 to see his music start coming together); oh, that would be glorious! And yet the fact that I enjoyed Circuits so much speaks well of its merits as a game.  ---- Pbbt (Epilogue) ------  Of course it was not a greater blessing. The man remained lost and in love.  Yet the laughter of children did make him happy, and if it was not the greatest happiness he could imagine - well, those who fly too close to the sun often plummet to their death.  Still, for the rest of the life, the man woke from dreams where he sang to rapturous applause - ' O Freunde, nicht diese Töne! Sondern lasst uns angenehmere anstimmen, und freudenvollere. ' When his eyes blinked open, sometimes he would lie silent. Sometimes he would wipe tears from his eyes. And sometimes he would smile and grasp the fleeting substance of his dream, using what was left behind to light the shadowed places of his soul. ----------------------------",1,0

From designing your Pretender God to laying out your troop formations, your decisions have a very real impact in the style of game you will play and the options that are open to you.  If you prefer style over substance, this game doesn't have the visual flash you're looking for.

326410,Windward,"I was having a ton of fun with this game - it is rather grindy, and can be unfair at points, and is almost obtuse in its ability to explain basic functions, but can be fun. It's like Diablo - you want to stop playing because you feel you aren't making good progress, and then a cool rare item shows up.  And then all of that gets destroyed by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ save system. There isn't one, you see - it saves when you exit. Or 'periodically' or whatever that means. I couldn't tell you when it saves. Well, actually, I can - right after your computer is shutoff thanks to a random brownout. Or more specifically, right after you go back into the game and try to restart your instance only to find out that the last 5 hours of progress have been wiped and they expect you to start your ♥♥♥ over in a new world with a ship that you traded in a while ago.  Yep - lost 5 hours worth of ships, rare items, gold, and everything. It isn't fun. And no, the backup didn't help - the backup WAS that old ♥♥♥ save FOR SOME REASON.  If I had manual saves, I'd have lost maybe a half-hour - tops. But that's not the 'design' of the game. It's some stupid hipster cloud ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about instances, and servers, and who-gives-a-crap. The game basically showed me lots of cool stuff and then robbed it from me. For that, it deserves a special place in hell.  I want my $12 back.",-1,1

409450,The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians,"Please note the following points before reading the rest of my review: - I haven't finished the game yet. I'm through slightly more than 50% of the Dungeon levels, which is probably a little less than 50% of the total playtime, since the first few levels were less complex. - I have more playtime than I can reasonably have accumulated on release day. I've bought the game through the developers' shop and activated it on Steam a few days ago. I didn't receive a review copy but instead paid full price. So this review is by no means biased by having gotten something for free. ;)  Now that that's out of the way back to the game:  Gameplay: First and foremost it is a grid based dungeon crawler that apparently draws significant inspiration from genre classics like Dungeon Master. There are no outdoor areas. The game (in contrast to for example earlier Might and Magic titles) is played in real time, meaning monsters will move and act even when the player doesn't do anything, but here an active pause function was implemented. This allows for a much more tactical combat experience than can be found in some other, more 'retro-ish' dungeon crawlers like Might and Magic X Legacy or Legend of Grimrock for example, where modern computer RPG features like active pause, hotkeys and quickbars where deliberately ommited to provide a gameplay experience closer to 'the classics of old'. Also in other regards there are nice comfort features that you could use. For example when you mouse-over a key on the map screen the place where you picked it up will be highlighted on the map. (EDIT: In my original review I mentioned at this place, that progress-relevant items like keys can potentially be almost invisible on the ground IF dropped in a very dark corner of a room falling close to a gap or stairs for example. This has since be fixed by a patch implementing an optional highlighting option for dropped loot, which can be switched on in the options ... just making the game even better.) The only thing I'm not so sure about is the number of classes. Since I'm still in my first playthrough it's hard to say, but there are only four classes. Even though the skill trees are quite varied and for example the man at arms may be played as a damage dealer or a tank... For longevity I think some more exotic classes would have been nice. (To be fair however: The classes in this game are MUCH more complex than in other retro-ish dungeon crawlers and I guess balancing additional classes would be quite a bit of work ... but still, would be nice. ;) )  Visuals: Overall the game provides a quite modern look while still reproducing the atmosphere in classic dungeon crawlers. If I were to compare The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians to other recent high profile grid based dungeon crawlers I'd say it's mostly on par with them, though if you are really looking at them comparing little details there might be a very minor lack of polish here. (One example would be: At the start of the game you go down to the bottom of the dungeon via elevator passing multiple levels and also some cross-bracings ... and that's where the edge of the platform merely clips brazenly through the cross bracings. ;) ) Once the intro sequence was over and I started playing I quickly got absorbed in the game to the point where I completely stopped noticing these miniscule hickups which are VERY rare anyway. The only thing that got a little bit 'more' negative after playing the first three levels was the lack of variety in wall textures within one texture set, which became apparent once I started spending more time searching for hidden switches, but I'd just say it's 'noticeable, but not problematic'. The different sets after clearing a few levels are very varied though and all are incredibly pretty and convey a very different atmosphere every time you change the 'area'. Also the spell effects and illumination look very nice. It's just incredible when you play in a dimly lit room and rain down fire on an entire group of enemies, temporarily lighting up everything just to see the ash of your incinierated foes fall to the ground while the dungeon (and your room) returns to it original lighting conditions.  Sound design: The sounds works very well with the game and overall the ambient soundeffects are very atmospheric and do a great job forming the overall positive picture.  Bugs: The only one I'm still having right now is that 5.1 digital surround sound via HDMI (from an nvidia GTX 970) doesn't work, but that's a Unity thing: Search their developer support Forums and you'll find out that most developers ultimately 'fix' the problem by using an original Creative Labs Soundblaster card, because the audio component of Unity just is very, very bad. Two other minor problems I had were so little I might not have noticed them had I not deliberately looked for problems. One was fixed before I could report it and the other one was addressed by the developer right away, who by the way is very responsive and friendly.  Conclusion: (note: this is prelminary, since I haven't finished the game!) The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians is a lot of fun. It's by no means an easy game, but it offers very comprehensive difficulty settings, which will allow the most casual of players to still enjoy the game while pure masochists will be served just as well. The atmosphere of the game quickly sucked me in. The representation of the deep dungeon and the sense of being lost in those tunnels ist just that strong and from what I've played so far I truly think it might just be one of the best grid based dungeon crawlers of the last few years.  (Also note that the game offers a map editor, but I didn't have time to check it our yet.)",1,1

None of the animatronics felt unique the only 2 that did were the puppet and withered foxy. The camera system to is a waste the only room you had to check was the music box but in fnaf 1 you actually were able to look around the place without looking at 1 room. This game is rushed and should have stayed in development until 2015 NOT 2014. I have to say the game isnt quite as good as the first one.

You can now focus on important things like bringing democracy and freedom to Rome's denizens without being burdened about said denizens' freedom to safely cross the street!   Veterans familiar with the series won't find anything new with this one-trick pony, history buffs might recoil at the revisionist treatment of famous historical figures, and Ubisoft's game launcher remains awkward.

And that's fine. It's a good game, but a problem comes in the fact that it, like I said, isn't finished. There are still situations in which a certain boss (Lil Hunter) can make or break you with no real input on the other player's side. You can go into that fight and have a clear room to fight him in, or a room full of enemies, even multiple elite variants. Glitches, crashing, and general confusing issues are also problematic. I assumed these things would be fixed once it was out of early access, but even after acknowledging it in November, it's May, and it still isn't fixed. As it is right now, I simply cannot reccomend the game. If you want a good shoot-em-up roguelike, you might wanna try Enter the Gungeon. I've only heard good things about it.",-1,1

251060,Wargame: Red Dragon,"Tl:dr; It's epic, intense, extremely detailed and takes a while to learn.  Do you cringe to see your RTS tanks and helicopters move at the same speed? Do you want a modern style RTS on a big scale? Do you want semi-realistic ranges, strength and fighting power for anti-air, vehicles, tanks, infantry? Look no further.   Wargame has (to me) been the breath of fresh air the RTS genre sorely needed. It's on a massive scale, and allows you to zoom out to see the entire map, but you can also zoom in to follow a particular unit in incredible detail.   This game has been around for a while, but thanks to the community, the devs are still working on putting new nations out.  Next to the positive things mentioned above, here are a few things you should consider before buying: -The scale works both ways, it's easy (as a beginner) to get stomped by something you didn't know existed. -The learning curve is very steep in the beginning, know that you need to make your own unit deck, since the default ones are useless. -Don't read the chat if you're easily offended. -(in my opinion) There's little GOOD wargame footage on youtube etc. from which you can learn as a beginner, reach out to the community to get some good decks at the start!",1,1

(true story btw) The new content from Enemy Within really completes the game. There is a lot more to do and if you play it on marathon it is almost like playing the classic game.  I noticed a couple of profoundly troubling things regarding the game and its length. It is way to short to be an xcom game. Xcom games are supposed to be a time sink.

I am a huge Metal Gear fan, as you can see from my hours spent on the Phantom Pain(which i do recommend).   The whole experience feels flat, just when the game starts to crank up, it's over.   Do yourself a favour watch someone play through it and buy the Phantom Pain.   Cons - Too short, doesn't feel fleshed out, Demo-like, controls aren't as sharp as previous MGS.

391540,Undertale,"I would highly recommend this game. It has a great plot, characters and battling system, also to add on to that, you don't have to kill anyone! Which is great. Finally, there's an RPG where you don't have to kill anyone. There are also many interesting secrets, an example is W.D Gaster a creepy and mysterious character. The game isn't very long, yet you feel like you spent so much time playing the game. Every minute of playing this game is worth it. There are also three paths you can choose, such as neutral, where you spare some people and kill some people, then there's genocide, where you kill everyone and in the genocide run everything becomes dark, depressing and violent, the one good quality of the genocide run is that, you get to fight sans in the genocide run. Sans is a skeleton with a brother named Papyrus, I would say that sans is the best boss you could spend you're time fighting. Anyways back to the different paths, then there's pacifist, where you spare everyone and encounter one of the best bosses Asriel Dreemurr. One of the reasons I love the Asriel Dreemurr boss fight is, because it's a boss battle with lots of hope, which is something I usually don't see in other games. Here's another quick thing to add on, this is a 'kids game' and yet despite being a ' kids game' it can be so dark and it just flies over kid's heads. I really respect that and I enjoy when something can be a little dark, because it's something you normally wouldn't see in a ' kids game'. Now as for the graphics, i know people who have criticized Undertale's graphics, really my opinion on that is that, I love Undertale's graphics, despite it being pixely and for me that just enhances the experience and it just overall fits the game itself. After saying all that in all I would give Undertale a 10/10, I highly recommend playing this game and I don't think I will ever see a game like this again. ",1,0

49540,Aliens: Colonial Marines,"The co-op  might  be considered fun, if you're in an extremely generous mood. Unfortunately, you'll still be left with the feeling that you were cheated out of your money as it's clear that this game was very poorly planned and executed by all parties involved with its development. The further you advance through the game, the easier it is to see that they progressively cared less about delivering a quality product and more about simply meeting their deadline. It's not unlike a 10-page essay written by an extreme (but slightly charming and able) procrastinator who uses double-spacing and 16 pt. font to make it  look  like a 10-page essay, and then proceeds to forget to check the spelling and grammar.

It's not a good platformer it's based around touvh controls and you can feel it. It's slow and very easy to avoid things with a control. It's more of a puzzle game that anything else, the story is decent but due to it pausing the game every time there is something to say it really slows you down and personally takes me out of the experience. Don't buy this for a plattformer game it's really not. Being a port some of it feels rushed the menu isn't very good with a controller and it can be difficult to deal with at times.

It is a very, very luck based board game, in which you kill your opponents and enemies in order to gain wins and stars. Get enough of either, and you can win. Despite being very luck based, it still has a bit of skill and strategy throughout the game. Using various cards and judgement, you can sway the game in your favor just so slightly. The visuals of the game are very pleasing, nothing looks terrible. The music is amazing, especially some of the DLC characters. It may not be a game for everyone, but it is a game you can love (and hate at times) with friends.  And you will die. To seagulls. A lot. (Other enemies/characters, but mostly seagulls.

19900,Far Cry 2,"I've put in more than 40 hours into this game on the Xbox 360 version, as well as the non-Steam version, so don't mind the lowly 9 hours I've put into the game here on Steam.  This is a fantastic game, and I personally prefer it over Far Cry 3. I was a huge fan of the original Far Cry (no, not the one on Xbox called Instincts, but the very first one on PC!). It was a flawed but fun game, with glitchy AI but beautiful levels and an open world design, where you could do a mission multiple different ways. I was worried when Far Cry 2 was announced to be in Africa and not a tropical island like the first, and that Jack Carver wouldn't be returning. I bought Far Cry 2 anyway when it released on PC, back when games didn't always come with Steam keys.  I was immediately addicted. The game is very gritty, with just about everything out to kill you. It's definitely not for casual gamers.   Weapons start rusting and breaking after long uses, eventually exploding in your hand, damaging you and forcing you to scavenge for a weapon off the ground while enemies are shooting at you from all directions. Cars can start to break down, requiring you to quickly get out, pop the hood, and use your magical wrench to fix it all while enemies are driving down the road trying to find you.   Bones will break. Shrapnel will stab into your thigh. Bullets will require pulling out of your arm. You'll need to heal yourself, which uniquely has your character fix himself through multiple animations of ripping out large chunks of metal from his legs, bandaging himself, etc. It all looks fantastic and gives the game, as I said earlier, a very gritty feel.  The game is flawed, just like Far Cry 1. The AI is iffy. It's hard to stealth. The story isn't delivered very well. Everyone talks like they've got to get to the last rocket off Earth. There's respawning guard outposts (though you can easily go around them, to be honest). But even with all of that said, I still think the game is much more unique and fun to play compared to Far Cry 3. I love exploring Africa, it looks gorgeous. If you ask me, I think the engine they used for FC2 (Dunia Engine) looks much better than the slightly cartoon-y style FC3 had with the Dunia Engine 2.  I'd recommend the game if you're looking for a different, less casual type of FPS. It's got an incredible amount of detail, the weapons are fun to use, there's some very cool features like weapons breaking down, the healing system, and the way AI interact with each other (enemies will try to drag their friends away after they've been hurt, for example).   It's a very underrated game, and I hope one day we'll get another Far Cry like this. One that isn't afraid to be different and try new things.  EDIT:   I recently started playing Far Cry 4 on my Playstation 4, and I just wanted to say that if you were a fan of Far Cry 2, but sad that FC3 removed a lot of the neat ideas 2 brought with it, you should definitely check out FC4.   It feels like a mix of all the things I loved about FC3 and brought back a few things I missed that FC2 had, like fire realistically spreading (FC3 sorta had it still, but it didn't work well), being able to go to sleep to change to a specific time of day, and hell, even a certain character returns from FC2! I won't spoil who it is, but it took me by surprise, since he wasn't a particularly big character in FC2. He's also the first recurring character in a Far Cry game, other than one other character who returns from FC3. Seems like Ubisoft is starting to make the games connect a bit!",1,1
251060,Wargame: Red Dragon,"Best strategy game ever made. Nothing even comes close to how good this game is in scale, control scheme, realism, and thoughtful gameplay.

281990,Stellaris,"The early game where you are slowly unveiling the galaxy for the first time is enjoyable. You're discovering what the game has to offer and thinking ahead about space you want to control. Who will be your allies and enemies?  There are problems later in the game, unfortunately. For example, the war system is nonsense. When war begins you are restricted to choosing roughly 3-5 planets that you will take from the enemy (there is a 100 point cost system for your war plan). During the war you can destroy all their armies and land troops onto every one of their worlds, but in the end you can only accept the 3-5 planets you declared initially.  This means that you have to declare war multiple times against an enemy to eliminate them. When a war ends you enter a period of peace (a long period) which you must wait to expire before war can be declared again. This is simply tedium because you've already destroyed their army and scooped valuable planets out of their empire.  Worse, if you are in a federation (which is how I chose to play) then you can only declare war every 40 or 50 years or so (which is probably a few hours of play, though I have not run a stopwatch on it). During the periods you cannot declare war you're twiddling your thumbs hoping the current federation president accidentally declares the war you want, or that your enemies declare a war against you (though the AI is not likely to declare a war against your superior empire). The system is incompetent.  There are numerous bugbears throughout the game that suggest development ended prematurely. For example, you're forced to yield control of planets to the AI, but this AI neglects your citizen's basic need of happiness, giving rise to rebellions (what this game calls 'factions').  The UI is sometimes obtuse and on occasion wildly misleading. You will make several mistakes on this basis. For example, the game mislead me to colonise planets with the wrong species, resulting in them being miserable and rebellious. On top of this, the game offers poor or no solutions to correct the problem. These planets I made mistakes on are likely to be permanently doomed. My only out is to become evil and purge (kill) them, but this would be suicide due to the political ramifications.  I hope they can improve and polish these systems with further iterations of this game (patches, DLC, expansions, whatever). In the meantime I think you're better off playing a 4x game that is more mature.",-1,1

They really 'bend' lightning and objects around, and the game is very creative when it comes to using them. The atmosphere is top-notch, Outlast tier. The story is (would be?) the most important aspect of the game, but falls flat on its face.

Proves that we don't need jumpscares to have good horror games, since the atmosphere really stole the show and it does make me want a sequel of the game. One that doesn't have such a bad main character and lousy story.  Overall, it's a average-to-good game and I recommend it for its price, but don't expect anything from the story or the characters.

264360,,"It's a fairly generic MMO, similar to games like MapleStory. Despite that, I find it a lot more fun than that. Unlike games like MapleStory, the progression is a bit more obvious. Therefore, you don't really have to pay much attention to the actual game to keep going, and can just do other things while mashing your number keys and going from quest giver to quest giver. I've spent over 100 hours in this game in under a week, and I don't feel burnt out about it. If you have free time up the wazoo, and can get lost in MMOs easily, go wild.  7/10",1,0

396090,Rogue State,"I've went back and forth on deciding whether to up or downvote this game and I have decided to downvote. The reason for my downvote is simple, after a couple play throughs you realize the game lacks depth. I have failed in only my first play through and then scored over 900 on all play throughs afterward. Did I just magically become a genius? No, it is because I found the trick to succeeding every single time. I of course ignored this flaw because I thought the developers were going to continue to improve the game over time. I was wrong. In a recent news update it has come to light that the game will only be maintained via bug squashing and support. So basically this is the finished game.   I was really hoping for more interactions with other nations, russia needs to be more than a minor detial, and more random events that forced the player to adapt. Due to these limitations, it seems there are really only a couple ways to truely succeed. This is of course a problem when the description of the game includes, 'a world of possibilities' as one of the reasons to buy.",-1,0

250600,The Plan,"Although with a 6-minute run time and only costs the low, low price of free, The Plan does not really stand out as a must-play. It seems to aim to be much more than it actually is- it's really over-sentimental and cliché in graphics (although I greatly thank the developers that they did not use pixel art). Its message is lost on me, probably because I'm a cynic, but also because it's simply overwrought and too self-aware that it's an 'art' game.",-1,0

300550,Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut,"I enjoyed Shadowrun, I enjoyed Dragonfall, and the Director's Cut is, without question, a solid improvement on both.  The new content is well-balanced for the timeframes in the campaign at which they are accessible, and add interesting depth to various characters (this is particularly noticeable for the Lodge mission!)  The new tactical interface is a vast improvement over something that already was pretty solid and functional, and Harebrained has patched out what few glitches I noticed within days of release.  Overall, I'd strongly recommend this, even if you were leery of the original Shadowrun release.",1,0

44350,GRID 2,"Race Driver: Grid is a beloved modern classic, so everyone had huge expectations for GRID 2. I myself bought it on day one...  Sadly, some basic features are missing in GRID 2: - Cockpit view - Assists options (this is a huge one) - chat in online lobbies   And... The DLCs are overpriced and they further split the now small community (the game is region locked). Codemasters implemented the so called 'TrueFeel Handling System'. The handling is constant drifting on 'ice covered' tracks, because if you keep on the non-existent racing line/not drifting you take the corners slower - ridiculous!   Less cars, less liveries (most are ugly, a thing a 10 year old would put on a car) Small amount of mostly fake tracks which are very narrow, making a regular online race into a crash derby + all that social media / 'fans' thing in the single player campaign... No words.  You are not a racer, you are a teenage pop-star, who is given cars to drift/crash and show off to the crowds. That is what Codemasters went for.  A shallow copy of Race Driver: Grid...  At least they had the decency to leave out 'Race Driver' . Good choice, Codies.",-1,0

99700,NightSky,"Nightsky is a casual physics platformer puzzle game with exceptional sounds and graphics. Although, despite sounding and looking amazing, it’s gameplay can be repetitive, I can still recommend this and here’s why.  Pros:  ♦ Great Atmospheric Graphics (It’s simple art style but it all fits together and looks amazing) ♦ Relaxing Eargasmic Sound (Relaxing and calming sounds that just fit together and make playing the game so much better) ♦ Relaxing/chill gameplay (Gameplay isn’t 100% but if you want a game you can easily pick up and put down in your spare time or want something to relax to, then this hits the nail on the head) ♦ Nice number of easy achievements (You can get all the achievements just by completing the game) ♦ Reasonable price considering the amount of work that has gone into the Graphics and Sound (Though if you are buying it for the gameplay, I’d say buy it on sale for a couple of bucks) ♦ Controls that just work (They just work) ♦ Interesting Vehicle Concept (I won’t spoil it, but vehicle concept is very interesting and fun) ♦ Interactive Credit Concept (This was a nice little way to do the credits and made reading them that little bit more enjoyable)  Cons:  ♦ Really Repetitive (I say this as I was happily playing and then all of a sudden when I expected the game to almost be finished, it tells me there are more levels but to progress I have to redo the old levels and find a “Hidden Star” which it never told me about. This concept is so annoying, as having to redo levels you’ve already completed to find a hidden object just to progress the main storyline seems really redundant and stupid) ♦ Really Easy (For 90% of the game all I had to do was hold down the left or right arrow and roll to the next screen/part of the level. This is kind of silly for a puzzle game to be this easy) ♦ Non-Existent Puzzles (I say this as I mentioned above I could hold left or right and progress easily. Also the only puzzles I seemingly found were timing jumps or rolling balls into the correct spot at the correct time, which I imagine a 5 or 6 year old could figure out easily) ♦ No Steam Trading Cards (Would be a nice addition as the graphics of the game are amazing and I imagine they could create some really stunning backgrounds, emotes and badges). ♦ No way to tell how far you have progressed in a level or how many are left (There is no level numbers and I could only seemingly tell how far I had progressed via exciting and selecting the level I was on. Then again it still didn’t tell me how much of that level I had left and how many more levels were left. The only way I could tell how many levels were left was via the Achievements. This concept is annoying as they should show each level and part of level as locked, not hidden, to make it easier to know how far you have left). ♦ No real storyline (Tried to implement some kind of Storyline but never executed it well enough to make any sense or significant impact on the game) ♦ Wasn’t aware some levels had hidden objects that I needed to collect to progress later in game (Not being aware of this until I needed these hidden objects to progress is really annoying as I would have searched and collected them on my first run through to save me having to repeat the levels again just to find one hidden object)  On a Side Note:  ♦ I haven’t finished the game as much as I wanted to because even though I had only played 2-3 hours of it, it was already getting on my nerves. I say this because it was repetitive and never really offered anything new in the terms of its puzzles per level and every time I progressed, I felt like I was just playing to get the next achievement. Then when I got to the point where it said I had to go back to levels I had already complete and find hidden Stars to progress… it just ruined the whole game for me and I closed it. I ultimately wanted something new, not having to go back and search old levels for something I missed on the first run.  Overall, even though there are a lot of cons, I never finished the game and probably won’t and the gameplay is repetitive, I can still recommend this. I recommend this if you want something easy and relaxing that has great graphics and eargasmic sounds. Therefore, I recommend you pick it up for that reason. However, if you are buying it solely for the gameplay, I’d recommend buying it on sale at the cheapest possible price due to lack of actual puzzles and how repetitive it is as mentioned in my side note and cons.",1,0
218680,Scribblenauts Unlimited,"There is literally nothing bad that I can think of about Scribblenauts Unlimited. The custom content allows you to add in virtually anything to the game to complete the puzzles with. So if you're stuck for a solution, make your own!  Also, the inclusion of adjectives in this game is something I wanted since playing the first Scribblenauts game, and they did it in a BIG way. You can come up with all kinds of strange things. For example, I bet you've never been able to say you were flying around on a giant rainbow penguin with demonic wings that could breathe fire. With this game, now you can.  Your creativity is the only thing that limits what you can do in this game (aside from the profanity filter). If you haven't played it already by now, do it. You'll have an absolute blast.",1,0

Im 30 hours in and barely into sequence 6. There is so much to do in paris that it is a never ending trail of fantastic entertainment. I couldnt imagine a better way to play through the french revolution. The charm of AC has always been its work into the detail in architecture and historical accuracy (to an extent of course, I know Shay Cormac didnt actually murder George Washingtons older brother).   So if I can help convince one person to play this game instead of listening to the glitch ♥♥♥♥♥ers, I did a good thing.

265550,Dead Rising 3,"Wait before buying this game.  I have a PC that could handle this terrible port most of the time. That said, I still experienced plenty of bugs that at best slowed the game and at worse crashed it. I enjoyed the game but there are many issues with this port and it has not been optimized for PC.  The game is basically what you would come to expect from the Dead Rising series. There are lots of zombies to kill and weapons to use. Crafting has been streamlined. Any item can be created at any time if the blueprints for it have been found and the items in the player's inventory. It is important to note that when leveling the character, Nick Ramos, any point put into unlocking crafting options does not unlock blueprints. Instead investing points in a crafting category will let the player use any item of a particular type to craft an item. For example, the 'Laser Sword' is a combination of a flashlight (electronic item) and gems (thrown item). If the player invests in the 'electronic item' category then they can use any electronic item and gems to make a laser sword. The game also features combination vehicles that can be made anywhere.   Survivors are no longer useless like they were in the previous games. Now survivors have half decent A.I., aren't restricted to escort/babysitting missions, and can be used to create a 'posse' that can be given basic orders (attack/follow/scavenge).  I recommend not using any DLC weapons or vehicles during normal gameplay as it can unbalance the game quickly.   Hours played: 66  Final score: 7/10",1,0
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,Pros: - Great Multiplayer and several hours of fun with friends (that's what matter right?). - Nice amount of co-op general missions (jobs). - Really need planning (or learning) to complete the heists.

Dissapointed, people said that updates had improved it, but after only 40 minutes I felt annoyed and frustrated by the controls and lack of feedback and guidance. I'm sure the late game stuff is as good as the older X titles, but those at least were fun and relatively simple when you got started and the controls were rudimentary but easily understood.   Poorly made game, I'm sure it has some redeeming qualities, but I'm afraid I don't see them. And frankly after years of making these games they seem not to have listened to any feedback at all.

287290,Resident Evil Revelations 2,"It seems I may have overestimated this game... But I cannot down rate it either.  The story is alright: survival horror is done right, I was really scared of glasps. Ammo is scarce, especially on higher difficulties, you'll get more points instead of the ammo. The plot is great too: lots of references to past RE games, we finally got Claire back,  but I really hate that stupid Barry's appearance change , (Scratched that because I solved this prob with a mod replacing his face with the one from Remaster). I also like that some of the mechanics from RE6 are back, like finishers. It kept me playing until I got all achievements and S ranks on all episodes and difficulties.  And now to the most disappointing part - the Raid Mode. At first it was really exciting, I've been replaying the first episode for 50 hours. All these new additions - passive and active skills they are really great addition to Raid. You can build up your own set of skills and create various play styles. There were only 2 gauntlets +1 I got from Throwback Map pack. I was looking forward to release of online feature and a new difficulty. Eventually after release of the last episode, the online feature was delayed, and we got a new difficulty which doesn't change enemy spawns, has 4 chests instead of 3, and all enemies were 6 levels above you. This couldn't bring any challenge. I've finished new difficulty a week before online was released. Then they promised to raise difficulty, and I had high hopes for this... and what did they do eventually?   They've risen the enemy's level by 15 above yours.  . Considering the power of my current guns, I can beat literally any stage on any difficulty with lvl 1. There was nothing new after online was released,  you can't even perform grapple breakers in co-op game  which is ridiculous, though you can perform them in campaign, how screwed up is that?  Conclusion: 7/10. This was the most awaited game for me this year, which I stopped playing much faster than expected.",1,1

58610,Wargame: European Escalation,"This game is really good, you have total freedom in the battle field, not preestablished commands like in Company of Heroes 2. Have to say it is quite difficult, specially the Warsaw Pact missions.   Pros: RTS game with not the tipical isometric perspective, you can zoom in and out from the meters scale to the entire battlefield. Sandbox, total freedom inside the battlefield, it focuses in tactics, not microscale fights. Quite cheap, and if you like it there are the two sequels: airland battle and red dragon.  Conts: Some missions are frustrating, very difficult, especially the ones in Poland, but saving the game regularly it can be done. A bit messy when you have all the factions mixed in the battlefield. I miss some military soviet music like in CoH2, btw the only good thing in CoH2.",1,0

The controls (On a xbox PC controller) Is very responcive. Loading times are quick.   Cons- Playing with a keyboard would make the game a little bit toughter, if you are used to playing previous lego games on console.  A must have for anyone who loves the lego games (I do!)

236690,Blood Bowl 2,"Welcome to the game of rolling dice, a simulator where it doesn't matter who you picked or what you do, because every decision you make comes down to whether you can roll 1d6. I played 12 games of this 'game' and let me give you a rundown of how each turn plays out. You get to move your players into positions to give them strategic advantages then fight the other team to knock them down. The most common 'advantageous' roll you'll get is 2d6 to pick one depending on what you want.  So you roll 2d6.  Double skulls. Skulls knock down your player, not theirs.  So you use one of your 'team rerolls' to change the outcome.  Double skulls. Your player falls over and your turn ends instantly.  You haven't moved anyone, or done anything. Your turn is done. The other guy then takes his turn, knocking down every single one of your team regardless of the odds. Heck, he can roll 2 dice disadvantaged and he'll 100% of the time score adouble knockdown that you can't avoid. Half of your team will be injured or KO'd in the first round and unable to play for the rest of the game which is IMPORTANT, as he now outnumbers you 11 to 5.  Now it's your turn again. Somehow get 2d6 to roll.  Roll double skulls.  Use a reroll?   Double skulls.  You're saying to yourself at this point 'wow, this guys just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting. What a moron this never happens to me'. I played 12 games and this happened at least once in EVERY SINGLE GAME. Did it happen to my opponents? NO. If they tried to make plays where they needed to dodge twice, each time at 17%, would they make it? 100% of the time, yes. Not a single person I played against lost more than 2 rolls in the entire match. By the time it got to game 10, I was so sick of this rng nightmare that I was conceding on the third turn after most of my team were dead or had broken legs and missing limbs while his players were at the line with not a single penalty.  I was under the impression that thinking about this game mattered in some way, but trust me, it doesn't, If I could go lower than 1/10 I would for this, but for the sake of it, lets just leave it at 1/10. Without reducing my settings to the lowest possible on quite a high end machine, the game crashed out constantly or took so long to register an action that a quarter of my turn was already wasted by the time people moved. On the first day I played, the servers were so broken it was disconnecting people midway through the match which forced both teams to concede a loss.  This game is -not- playable in its current state and I would not recomend any of you spend even £5 on something you could replicate by buying 3d6 and shoving them down your friends throat while their young children watched. £35 is like asking a poor man for 3 of his limbs to give him a cup of water, not even slightly worth it.

102600,Orcs Must Die!,"Orcs Must Die is a third person, action, tower defense game. You play as the War Mage, who's job is to kill Orcs, often in rather comical ways. In each level, the Orcs will spawn in waves and try to enter the rift and it's your job to kill them. This done via laying traps, using weapons, or placing guardians to fight by your side. After each level, you will be given a new power to use and skulls based on how well you did; the less Orcs that make it through the rift and the faster you do it, the more skulls you earn. These skulls can then be spent on upgrades for your traps and guardians.   After many hours of gameplay and tens of thousands of Orcs slain, I can safety say that this game IS FREAKING AWESOME. I've sunk about 45 hours into this game (counting the dlc missions). Let that sink in: 45 hours of gameplay! There are triple A games out there that give a fraction of gametime with several times the cost. It's a steal, esspecially if you can get on sale.   However, this game is about exactly one thing: killing Orcs. Beyond that, there's really nothing else to do, but for its price, its a hard deal to beat. If your own the fence, try the demo or watch some clips on youtube. And if you like what you see, buy it. Especially if you can get the entire series bundled and discounted.

(note i'm not a racing fan nor am i a soccer fan it does help to atleast like one or both of them).  The price is simply too much for a simple game like this. It doesn't have enough in it to keep my intrest in the long run. Sure i play a few rounds with mates, but after 2-3 rounds i'm already starting to get bored.

Despite the frustrations, it was still fun and entirely solvable. There is a story plot which is... crazy. The frustrating parts I had: rules do not always seem sufficient to play - sometimes you have to make intuitive guesses about the nature of the clues themselves. Keep in mind the golden rule for this game: 'all puzzles should be optimaly solved.' Remember this rule - often times you may find ONE solution, but it is not the BEST solution. (Insect boxes come to mind here) Sometimes how the puzzle works is not apparent until you start clicking on things, or clicking for a hint. Sometimes the rules or hints themselves are sub-optimal. Sometimes it is simply a click or drag fest (the 'dont overlap pieces puzzles) But don't worry, you should have all those bubble gum hints saved up, and I think three attempts on one puzzle was the worst I did. I will pass on one spoiler type hint    Certain CODES can be solved by looking at the Negative space, or by covering the left or right half of a symbol   ",1,0

This game really deserves more praise. It is easily the most unique 'classic' MMORPG. Of course, there are a few minor issues (Most of it is getting used to navigating the map system); but, what MMO doesn't have them? This game is perfect for Final Fantasy fans while being very accessible to people who know nothing of the series. This is the ONLY MMO that I have ever played that I actually feel deserves a monthly subscription. I have played WoW off and on from 2006-2013. I played Guild wars from release until 2011. I have even played Guild Wars 2 since closed Beta until recently. Of course, I have played alot of other MMO's. That being said, FFIV: ARR has interested me and entertained me FAR more than any of those MMO's. It has a certain charm that the other MMO's that I have played don't have. I honestly feel like this is the most 'well-rounded' MMO that exists. I recommend everyone to pick it up and see for themselves. It never hurts to try!

212800,Super Crate Box," SCB  is a great arcade game, one with gameplay that can be enjoyed in any decade, same as other great arcade games like  Asteroids Deluxe . The objective is super easy to grasp and easy to control in a way that feels like eating comfort food while snuggled in bed. That written, the gameplay itself is active and captivating; challenging and non-stop. The sounds and music all do their job well, with the exception of the bad menu theme and annoying menu sound effect(s). The unlock progression is good, and the game's short play length is extremely easy to come back to time and time again. You could play this game for five minutes or two hours and have an equally great time either way. I never get bored of this game (partially because of the weapon changing), and I can feel myself get better at it the more I play.  The game is free (not from lack of quality).

It's pretty much everything you loved about the old games: fast, close and fun races; innovative tracks based on breakfast tables, playrooms, school rooms and pool tables.  You can even set the view to the classic 'top down', which makes it a lot easier to spot short cuts but isn't really how the game is meant to be played.  The single player campaign is rather short. I finished it in less than four hours, which is something to be aware of.  I also found online to be a little bit buggy and laggy, though this could have been my connection rather than a server side issue. I'd have to play more to find out.  I haven't played local multi-player yet but it should be a hoot!  If you're not sure, try the demo. For me it turned this game from a 'wait until it's on sale' to a 'I need this right now!'

63710,BIT.TRIP RUNNER,"Sweet controls. Engaging music. Rad grafix. INDIE DELIGHT!  I played the demo for this game back when it first came out on the Wii and instantaneously fell in love with it. The super-hip use of the retro-esque style really caught my eye. Not to mention I'm a sucker for colorful things. Although the look of BIT.TRIP RUNNER is what brought my attention to this game... it was the awesome, tight controls that made me stay. It's a great mix of platforming, style, and controls that anyone who can appreciate those things should consider picking it up.  The aesthetics and minimal-yet amazing controls aren't the only great things about BIT.TRIP RUNNER! The music for this game is also magnificent. Little beats come out whenever you successfully pass an obstacle. It's so cool. It really makes you feel like you're a part of the game, as though you are orchestrating these really cool tunes. Personally, it's the game's best feature.  Despite it being such a cool game, at times it CAN be a bit frusterating. Especially if you aren't particularly great at platformers (I have no problems there, considering I'm a wiz at platformers!) You'll find yourself getting screwed over by obstacles that you don't know are coming, which will take you back to the beginning of the level. But then you'll know what's in store for you! So don't give up!  And getting to the finish line is one of the most satisfying things.  All in all, I have deep appreciation for the game, and this review was more a way for me to publicly gush about this game than it is a review. If you're reading this, you already know that I think this game is great. So go try it for yourself and see if you like it!

Unlike it's competition, the challenge is in building a successful settlement and that all depends on micromanaging it's development while weathering the natural disasters of everyday medieval life. Those disasters include weather, the dangerous work of mining, and the great risks of fire, starvation, and disease. You'll likely abandon a few towns before you get this game right, but it's interesting to watch life unfold and it feels rewarding to succeed. It's a perfect game to sit down with a hot drink in the evenings and just mellow out to the calm rhythms of rustic life.",1,0

242800,,"Scores are at the bottom.  Setting:   You are Garry; an alcoholic mourning the loss of his family. One afternoon, you go for a plane ride on business to deliver a few things. All of a sudden, a volcano erupts, and the turbulence bring you down. Even though you were certain to die, a strange package activates an ancient power in an attempt to save you. You wake up, about to be sacrificed to an aboriginee tribe's deity. You notice that there was something even stranger about these people. You free yourself, kill your opposition, and solve an ancient puzzle that hides an ancient weapon. The temple caves in, and you just barely escape death for the second time. This is where the game begins.  Review:  Usually, when I see a game with such negative reviews, I'm ever tempted to buy it, just so I can confirm the reviews are honest. I had just gotten a USD $50 gift card for Steam. I bought the games I wanted, and had USD $4 remaining or so. I'm very impatient when I have money, so I had to find something to spend it on. This game, along with Takedown: Red Sabre, came on sale for USD $1.49 each. I caved, and bought both. I will tell you, the time I have in this game was real play time; not just letting it run for cards. That was just compensation for the time I wasted in this game.  I usually appologize or beg to be heard out for giving a negative review, but I feel it's not necessary here. As soon as you load the game, you notice your framerate drop tremendously, even on higher performance PCs. After you find a way to stablize your framerate, you begin the game. You see a dream of your character's wife calling to him. The dream ends, and you see your character. It's obvious that cutscenes were a last minute idea for the game. I've seen more stable animation in Garry's Mod. Why, oh why do you share this man's name, Garry? The voice acting is less than pleasent, and the graphics are horrendous on all but the highest performance PCs. The story is not well put together, but passable. The inventory system is interesting, and is good in concept, but severely lacking in implementation. The bad combat system and bountiful amount of bugs almost rival that of Aquaman: Battle For Atlantis. Almost. Oh, who am I kidding; nothing is worse than that. The plus, however, is that the game does have a good soundtrack. That alone may save it from getting eternally condemned to the less than 4/10 zone.  Scores:  Story: 5/10 Stability (Lack of Bugs): 2/10 Stability (Performance): 2/10 Combat System: 3/10 Soundtrack: 8/10 Replay Value: Undecided...  Final Score: 4/10. Recomended buy price: Undecided...  Final Thoughts:  That was honestly unintended. I consider a game 'condemned to death' if their overall score goes below 4/10 (even if it's 3.9999999999999999999999999999999) which is generous, considering most people say that about 6/10 games and sometimes even higher rated games. I cannot recommend this game. I will play it again, if at least just to complete the story mode and establish the score for replay value. If you genuinely want to judge this game for yourself, I won't (and can't) stop you from buying it. I do, however, recommend that you AT LEAST buy it when it's on sale for USD $1.49.",-1,0

230230,Divinity: Original Sin (Classic),"I avoided this game for a small time as I was a backer of Pillars of Eternity and assumed this was merely a knock off given the success PoE had in crowdfunding. I was wrong.  When I finally got the game, I really wish I'd got it sooner. Few games compel me to 'trophy hunt' but this is one of them. In fact, only three Steam games ever have; this, GameDev Tycoon and Skyrim. Though the latter I no longer have everythign thanks to expansions.  What really makes this game great is the sheer amount of choice. It really reminds me of my days playing Baldurs Gate or Aracanium. But also the dialogue is quite amusing. Sure some bits are a little obvious but others less so. It doesn't have much in the way of difficult puzzle solving, but it's still a fun story to play though.  I waited on reviewing the game until my PoE had come in. I backed at $350 tier and was eaglery awaiting PoE. While I've only spent a few hours in it thus far, it did not grab my attention like Original Sin did. I'd therefore have to say thus far Original Sin blasts PoE out of the water. My only gripe is character progression, I'd like to have seen something a little more closed in so that classes were more meaningful.",1,0

The gameplay is highly similar to the Uncharted series, which is a extremely good thing, but the shooting is much more tactful (somewhat like The Last Of Us) on normal+ difficulty, where ammo is not abundant for anything except the bow until late in game, (I think i stopped using the bow approx an hour from the end due to many enimies).

Pros    Challenging after about 10 days ingame   Great music at each time of day   Leveling + Perks   Cartoon graphics, this might not be a good thing for the  HARDCORE GRAPHICS  people   Other things I cant think about as of writing this     Cons    Tutorial, but once you know its easy   UI a little bare, probaly will improve   Price changing; you set it to a % increase, but you have to change it for other items for example: Sword = 150%, but then you want your Boots to be set lower, so you have to change it. Then someone knocks your Sword off, then you have to pick it up and put your price back up to 150%, and so on. It gets to a point were you just keep everything at one %, only thing that would need to be done is make each item have thier own price mark up, so this isn't a problem.

Yes, it's very crude and sets out to offend, and production values are pretty low, but that's actually the point, and in fact where the wacky fun comes in. I don't play video games to be polictically correct!  The very wide variety of weapons and items in an open world with plenty of NPC in-fighting allows for creative play which IMHO is unmatched by any game in recent history. The fact that you can wee on yourself to put out a flesh fire is unprecedented (and dare I say, unlikely to be replicated) in gaming history and reason enough to experience this game.

241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"WARNING: SPOILERS  If you're a fan of The Lord of the Rings franchise, then this game is definitely something you should consider playing. Personaly I haven't seen any of the LotR movies or read the books, although I have seen both of The Hobbit films that have been released to this date and I immediately fell in love with them, and after playing this game I am much more interested in the Middle-earth Saga.  For those who don't know, the LotR universe and The Hobbit universe are both set in the same place: Middle-earth.Therefore within Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, you are going to come across some very recognisable characters if you are a fan of the fantasy orc slaying franchise. Anyway, lets get on to talking about the game itself. You play as Talion, a once Captain of an army called The Watch. After your Wife and Son were slain before you by someone known as The Black Captain, you soon await your turn along side your family. After facing certain death, you are resurrected by a powerful Wraith who was once a man working for The Dark Lord, Sauron. Talion being unknown to this Wraith's true identity aswell as the Wraith himself, they embark on a quest to find out who he is and where he came from.  The gameplay in SoM is outstanding. Put aside a few glitches and bugs that I have encounted, Monolith Productions did a near perfect job on the mechanics. The combat is very familiar to any that have played The Arkham series, some developers have tried this kind of mechanic, but only a few have made it work, like they have in this game in particular. The parkour feels very similar to Assassins Creed and the way Talion moves feels very life like and not choppy or glitchy. The Wraith who's soul is bound to yours, gives you superhuman like abilities, such as jumping off incredible hightes without taking damage and being able to take control of Orcs and turning them against each other. Talion, being a Ranger for most of his life is very skilled in combat. He wields a Sword named Urfael and a Dagger named Acharn. They can both be upgraded throughout the game using collectable items called Runes. Each of his weapons have unique ablities when equipped with a Rune. The Wraith is a very skilled Bow man, and holds with him Azkâr (his bow). Azkâr too can be upgraded by Runes.  The graphics are absolutely beautiful. By far some of the best I have seen in any video game. The character designs are incredibly life like and have insane amounts of detail put into them. The voice acting is fresh and faultless, and when it comes to the Orcs and Uruks, they sound exactly how I'd have imagine them to. Sometimes it is admirable to use the newly added screen shot mechanic to pause the game and just gaze at how brilliantly designed the Monsters and enemies look in this game. The Graug, which is a fifteen feet tall troll like creature, looks incredible. I wouldn't want to come face to face with one of them in real life.  One thing I do have to talk about in this review is probably one of the best features about SoM, the Nemesis system. The Uruks are ranked in this game according to what power level they are. The higher the level, the higher the ranking. They each have their own unique randomly generated name and personality. A feature that I do like is when an Uruk kills you, if you find the exact same one again it will recognise you and taunt you about the last time you and him met and lost. The Nemesis system is made up of Grunts, Captains and Warchiefs. Grunts are just a common Orc or Uruk that you, as the player, will come up againts throughout your journey but a grunt can prove itself by killing you and therefore be promoted to a Captain. A Captain is a higher level of Uruk, they are body guards to the warchiefs and are stronger than your common enemies. Warchiefs are the strongest kind of Uruk, and are not found on the map, instead they must be drawn out by completing a certain objective, for example killing a number of its own Uruks or killing off its supporters with a certain weapon. Once you have defeated a Warchief, it will drop a Rune which you can add to its assigned weapon. Although if it kills you, it will only grow in power, as of now the highest level of power it can reach is 20. However, each Nemesis has its weaknesses which can be discovered by interrogating an Uruk that holds intel or just by finding it on a note somewhere scatted around the map.   The world you play in is fairly big, and to save you from running on foot from place to place, you have the ability to take control of a terrifying beast known as the Caragor and ride it which increases your speed. As well as this, there are watch towers scatted around the map and, if discovered, you can fast travel to them. After completing the game, there is still a whole bunch of things to do, such as side missions which include killing a certain number of Uruks in a certain amount of time to earn an award or Mirian (the games currency), or freeing slaves of Sauron. There is also a few collectables in the game, such as artifacts and Ithildin. There are 42 artifacts spread out across Mordor, once you have found one you can activate its memory and listen to it which can sometimes be quite interesting. Ithildin, like artifacts, are spread out across Mordor. There are 32 of them and are small glowing markings hidden on walls and can only be seen once you are in the wraith world, this is also the case with artifacts. You can enter the Wraith world by pressing the assigned button on a controller or keyboard, this is used to locate targets or to spot artifacts and Ithildin.  Overall, it is a well polished game. With stunning graphics, brilliant gameplay and an intriguing story-line, I have fallen in love with it. Although, after a while the Nemesis system can start to get very old and boring, which takes the toll on the game since it plays a big part in it. Although it feels very rewarding when you slay a high level Warchief after it has defeated you multiple times, it can get very repetitive. With all of those points taken into account, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor gets a 9/10 from me.",1,1

Pros: Beautiful art direction Amazing soundtrack Good story Inventive real time/turn based combat  Cons: Super short (like 4 hours) Story is good, but not great. Charactes are uninteresting, plot seems unimportant. The combat, while inventive, is repetitive. It also doesn't seem to make much difference as to what weapons you are using.  If you can get it for under $10 it's worth it. $10-15 I'd say it depends on what kind of games you like, anything more than that I'd say pass.",1,0

286260,fault - milestone one,  Had a mate gift it to me and I really enjoyed it. Seems to be going to interesting places and it doesn't suffer from some of the tiresome visual novel problems. The only criticism I can raise is the wall of text in the intro moves too fast. So unless you're some kind of demon speed reader you may wind up watching it a few times to read the last quarter of each page. Overall very good and I would certainly buy it at full price.,1,0
237870,Planet Explorers,"Five and/or seven out of seven, depending on the quantum state of Dr. Allen Carter's interpretation of the afterlife.  It ain't a perfect game by any means. It's very unrefined, even after release; voiceovers of inconsistent quality, text sometimes reading more like a foreign language than English, story left open-ended, performance issues here and there, an end-game cutscene that makes the Uncanny Valley look shallow in comparison, those sorts of things. Planet Explorers has its trouble spots, to be sure.  Underneath that bit of rough, though, is a diamond, raw as it may be. This game's got good bones. Unlike most voxel-oriented games (including ones in the public spotlight much later), Planet Explorers offers the ability to build things on a smaller scale than terrain and buildings; vehicles, weapons, and even (to an extent) body armor are all able to be custom-designed by the player, and sharing these custom creations online with other players is an absolute breeze using the in-game workshop. Both the pre-defined map in 'Story Mode' and the procedurally-generated random maps in 'Adventure Mode' offer spectacular landscapes. The wildlife feels both familiar and alien at the same time, and the storyline - while rough in execution in many respects - is believable and engaging.  Most importantly, though, is a development team that has demonstrated itself to be committed to working with players to fix problems and continually improve the game. Communication has been bidirectional and top-notch, and the developers are quick to squish bugs as they're reported (even amid the influx of post-release feedback).  All in all, a great game. Rough around the edges, sure, but shiny and clean is for AAA shops; Planet Explorers is an example of an Early Access game gone right even amid the risk of things going horribly wrong (as tends to be the case for games with even a fraction of the scope offered by Planet Explorers).",1,1
375950,Viridi,"I would only hesitate to call this a game only for lack of a better description, but don't let that deter you from experiencing Viridi first-hand. A charming garden simulator focused solely on plants of the succlent variety, Viridi is quite the relaxing little gem on Steam.

Aside from the beautiful art the added sexual innueudo jokes in the game make it even more pleasing and found myself laughing. However, what made me not enjoy the game as much was the game's script. I felt that the story was lacking and one dimensional, especially with the problems such as the attack on the village being so short lived that i didnt really notice that much except one minor interapersonal struggle but it so overly used that it just didn't feel like I actual connected with the character, just boring. But I'm going to be honest here, i didn't exactly buy the game for storyline (LOL) but my point being that even though the women depicted are very sexy, if i enjoyed their individual characters more (aside from the jokes, and innuendos) it would've been more interesting!",1,0

While this game missed it's potential by a large mark, there is hope in the future for this game with updates, DLC, and hopefully lots of mods. It is much faster paced than the older X series games. It in itself is a very fun and enjoyable game, but if you are looking for great polish or amazing story pulled together by great voice acting and brilliant UI to help you through it... Look elsewhere.  If you can stand a few bugs, and some frustration, this game will keep you entertained for a long time. If not, look back at this game in 6 months to a year.",1,0

I am aware of the polemic controversy around this game and that's why I looked for it, planning to write a good review about it.

355050,Sky Force Anniversary,"Sky Force Anniversary: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Sky Force Anniversary is a classic fast and furious arcade shoot-‘em-up game.   You will have to go through 9 missions with each starting at the normal level. You will need to achieve 4 requested challenges to unlock the next difficulty level. There are 3 difficulties per level: Normal, Hard and Insane.   Every time you destroy an enemy, a star will appear at the exact place of its destruction. Make sure you collect as many stars as possible per mission. You will be able to spend your stars to upgrade your vessel health, guns, missiles, shield and Mega BOMB (YEAHHHHH). You will find out very quickly, it is important to upgrade your vessel or you will not be able to achieve your challenges or get through to the end of the mission.   Do not forget the people in red suits; they will need to be rescued too. Also, if one of your steam friends is playing Sky Force Anniversary you will be able to see where he/she was killed and you can rescue him/her for additional points.   There are also 22 in-game cards to collect and each of them has an additional ability which will be very useful to you. The game runs smoothly, has good graphics and a good soundtrack. I prefer using a gamepad but you still can play with the mouse and it is enjoyable too.   Positives: ~~~~~~~~   - Classic Arcade Game - Runs Smoothly - Plenty of goodies to upgrade and abilities to gain - Addictive - Achievements - Trading Cards  Negatives:  ~~~~~~~~~   - Would of like more levels - A bit repetitive  Looking for a fast, furious and addictive shoot-‘em-up game?

405640,Pony Island,"With all the overwhelming reviews for this title, along with the promise of psychological horror got me really interested, but playing this in the first place was quite the mistake  The game progressive at an alarming rate and becomes stale pretty quicky. The attempt at horror is just terrible, this game hasn't offered me any of that good old paranoia that a game of it's type promises. The dialogue feels rushed and it leaves no impact on me at all. The hacking bits were nice, but became somewhat boring and it didn't give me the degrees of freedom as I expected it to. The story seemed to have been alterable at first glance, but it's all in a fine line, everything along it, you see coming. This feels like nothing more than an flash game with a price tag, and that's what upsets me most.  I'm going to see if I can refund this, don't be fooled by the massive amount of short and undetailed positive reviews.",-1,1

The game's great late game and early game! the combat system is great for the time that this game came out and it has better graphics of alot of games from 2010 and some games from this year. The only two things that I don't really like is the music and how small the map is. I would definately reccommend this game to people that like medievalish games.

Don't listen to what these children are saying, they're the same type of people that buy 'Max Level' in MMOs, and then bully people with it.

207040,Sine Mora,"Cons -To many cheap deaths or unavoidable bullets, especially so durign bossfights -Not enough content. I beat the story mode in a bit less than an hour without much reason to go back besides getting a higher score. Which isn't fun when the missions the same everytime to me and is excacerbated by small number of missions. And small variaty in enemies and bosses. -Handles continues and deaths in a weird way. HP is accustomed to a timer. Killing things gets you a few seconds on your timer while getting it takes time. The timer is also always counting down and in the case it hits zero you die. You can use a continue to restart. Its just a weird system -In tunnel areas its extremely easy to hit a wall and possibly insta die because the hitbox of the wall and the graphic are not always in the same place as to allow you to know where you will take damage and not. -Hamfisted story thats hard to care about and gets more in the way than anything. -Narration in some made up gibberish language instead of english. At that point, why even narrate? -Everyone is an ugly furry, no sexy husky men or anthromorphic dragons or horses to be found.  -Repatitive gameplay thanks to lack of content.  Pros +Really good looking Shoot-Em Up. Both techincally and in graphical design and artistry put into characters, the world, and even the UI/menus. +Is still a fun game if you can look past the frustration from cheap deaths but probably still fun due to the basic Shoot-Em Up design behind it all   Summary Its an okay game. Don't be expecing a instant classic but its a game thats worth a dollar or two if you are interested in it. The current $10 retail is just to much with all I have seen in this game (which isn't a whole lot). Im actually glad I didn't get this on a Vita for more than I now think its worth.",-1,0

102500,Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™,"In 25 hours of gameplay time, I cleared out 8 regions out of 30 odd total regions. I don't feel like I'm progressing at all even though I'm at level 20. Game's original design being a MMORPG shows a lot and makes the game a huge timesink.  Let's proceed to the pros and cons:  Pros: -Good combat with interesting skills. -Artsyle is pretty good and immersive. -Lorestones are lovely with those pretty good ballads. -Character faces, bodies and animations are pretty good when compared to the something like Skyrim, but it's a result of game's aesthetic design. -Wonderfully crafted lore by R.A Salvatore. -Unique items actually mean something and finding one of them is very rewarding again unlike Skyrim. -Skill system is intriguing and allows many versatile gameplay choices. (Although I went with full might because Amalur belongs to the Nords!) -A good variety of combos.  Cons: -Towns are huge immersion breakers. They consist of three buildings and people sleeping on the inn halls. Also filler NPC's that give generic answers don't sleep at all. -There aren't enough dialogue options and having a high persuasion skill usually means better loot for the quest. (But one time, I managed to end a quest with it. NPC said 'But you had to die' I said 'But I don't want to die' then he went 'Oh, ok then.' that was great and hilarious.) -Too many shallow side quests with little variety. Gets very very repetitive and that's one of the major reasons I'm done playing KoA:R. -Regions are connected through narrow roads and you can't discover the sides of these roads. Instead of feeling like an open world game as it aimed, it becomes a network of regions. -No horses, no way to go through one end of the map to the other quickly. You're dependant on fast travel. -Enemies that you kill on the roads spawn back too quickly and it rather becomes a tedious task. -Not much diversity on enemy types. -Enemies do not have origins. Why Kobolds are Kobolds? Why Ettin are Ettin? Is their sole purpose of being in the game is getting killed by the player?  Grand Finale: Game is good, I can't bring myself to play to the end but for these 25 hours was pretty fun and I never felt so engaged to a game since Skyrim. But seeing that I'm at 25 hours and only completed 8 regions, I thought that I should stop. This was not a decision taken by boredom, in fact never felt boredom playing this game but it seemed like the logical thing to do. If you have time and like RPG games it's a must play. Even if you don't have enough time to complete the game you should play it for the atmosphere until you feel it becomes repetitive. For this kind of experience, this game is dirt cheap.  I feel like if the dev team had time, money and it wasn't built upon a failed MMO project, it could have been a great game. Unfortunately Big Huge Games bankrupted after low sales of this game, so we're not getting any kind of sequel. It's a damn shame because the world of Amalur is so immersive and has enormous potential as an universe.",1,1

I played a TR Engineer and had a blast with this game and felt good when I saved the life of a friendly MAX or vehicle.

My first 8 player FFA online made me feel like I was 15 again, skirting responsibilities to stay up later to play.  It is shallow however, but there are shades of greatness here.

234080,Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Ultimate Edition,"This is a mediocre game that suffers severely from several key flaws.   First and foremost, it is a very poor console port that suffers from severe playability issues. The controls are unfamiliar to PC gamers as the mouse is not used for anything in the game. You can bind keys to mouse clicks, but you can't look around with the mouse or even select things in menus using the mouse.  The problems continue as you're not able to exercise any control over the camera, so you're often presented with clunky and awkward viewpoints and the camera will sometimes change from behind-the-character to in-front, for no reason. This will cause you to start running back the other direction, which will then cause the camera to flip back the other way, which will cause you to once again start running the other direction... you get the idea.  The second, and really far worse problem is the pacing of the game. The game opens with a battle (as any good game in this genre should) but before you even get to the battle, you have to deal with an obnoxiously long scene of Gabriel riding into town. Each camera pan and tilt is torturously slow and I really found myself wanting to skip cutscenes even though they are usually my favorite part of a game. This went on for the entire first act, which is about when I quit playing.  It actually takes you about 2 hours of play and a wandering course through several bog levels to even hear a mention of the namesake Lords of Shadow. It is then revealed that they are bad guys (obvious though it may be) and they are responsible for your wife's death. Apparently they had never caused trouble before 5 minutes ago, so no one had bothered to kill them. This is the only explanation for why you basically just head out alone to take on the infinite undead army, with absolutely no backup (except for Captain Picard).   You're in the Order of Light, a completely generic brotherhood of knights committed to blah blah blah against the darkness. Unfortunately, all they are good for is dying of disease in convenient locations to provide you with loot. Shouldn't the Order of Light have been--oh I don't know--trying to kill the Lords of Shadow all along? In the game world, it is common knowledge who the Lords of Shadow are, what they do, and where to find them. It's no big deal that they are unleashing hordes of Werewolves, Vampires and Necromancers on humanity... until they killed your wife, I guess. And then once you do decide to kill them, you don't bother telling anyone else in your Order because you want the 'element of surprise.'   Not joking.  The ultimate evil in the world has been left to fester unchecked for so long that 2 guys with swords constitute a surprise attack. This isn't exactly a Pearl Harbor scenario. What exactly has the Order of Light been DOING? Oh right. Dying of disease. In a swamp.  The game does have some redeeming points. They hired Patrick Stewart (Jean Luc Picard) to do the lion's share of the voiceover work, and they definitely got their money's worth. He puts in his best Shakespearean effort, but some of the monologues are so long and meandering that I was often left wandering the point was. Again, the pace of the narrative was ridiculously slow.  There is a Shadows of the Colossus tribute battle where you fight a big Ice Titan, but it didn't have nearly the challenge or puzzle elements of the original. Still, it was a high point. Unfortunately there's another 15 minutes of meaningless dialogue immediately after it, which then dramatically reveals that you have to kill the obvious bad guys.  It's not often that I don't finish a game I start, but this is one of them. I simply can't put myself through any more of this.",-1,0

201810,Wolfenstein: The New Order,"Wolfenstein: The New Order is the latest main Wolfenstein game, a series of FPS games, which sometimes have very light stealth implented, where you shoot and kiss many Nazi and other fictional beings nearby. This time it was developed by MachineGames and published by Bethesda in 2014. Smartly enough, developers decided to focus fully on single-player, with no multiplayer modes. Otherwise it would have got hated by Return to Castle Wolfenstein multiplayer fanatics for not being same, who don't care about singleplayer campaign. Game was developed with Id Engine 5, also used in RAGE, and was also made for PS3, PS4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. There is no difference worthy to mention.  From technical side, I must note that AMD cards users will have harder times with this game. I remember how it would lag hard and crash even at intro movie at launch day. Good thing I updated to official Catalyst drivers and it got fixed, so I could enjoy my low-end laggy experience. No, I don't mind, I am used to being behind the times tech-wise.  The plot in this game is quite exciting. The Nazis, thanks to Deathshead, one of villians in previous Wolf games who now takes a main anatogonist role, advanced far above the Allies forces in technology, taking a horrifying shapes. It doesn't take them long to win the war and soon you will be out there, fighting your way through the world rebuild in evil Nazi ideology and style in 1960.  It's also executed cinematic-wise, awesomely. Blazkowich is back to his square-jaw and he now has non-stop inner monologues which deepens him as character. World is potrayed in dark tone. Your only friends are often weirdos. It has amazingly directed cutscenes and jaw-dropping setting. I also liked how action jumps from one point to another, and game never dumps a lot of info on you, saying little to create a big picture. Also helps with tastefully placed newspapers. Though it does have a lot of shockers. Adult thing and all. But at times it felt that some shockers were there just to increase the rating really. And why main hero is totally cool with NPC drugging him with boiled water, not punching into face?  You also get to make choice between two characters in the beggining of a story: Wyatt and Feigus. Big deal it's not. It barely changes cutscenes and story, they say same general things in each line. Just depends on how much you want to hear F-bombs. Feigus 'timeline' lets you find the permanent health limit upgrades, which is more useful than Wyatt's 'how much each armor pickup gives' upgrades. But also each of them gives you ability to access certain places and Wyatt seems to have more of them. Oh, and a single another NPC is different for each story.  Oh yes, upgrades are part of collectibles that you can find during each chapter. And the thing about collectibles and perks is that they are saved in your global profile, so choosing chapter will not reset them. Not sure about 'New Games' though.  Oh, yes, perks. Instead of grinding for experience, these work like achievements: You do some certain stuff, like kill 3 enemies without releasing fire button while dual-wielding, and then you unlock a small upgrade, which slightly makes it easier for you. All of them are categorized after certain playstyle, which should help you get better at what you like to do best. Though I just challenged self to get them all during main play.  And yep, there are few playstyles. While you can't really beat game just by stealth or mayehm, it helps variety, lots of fun. You can stealth sometimes, which is quite easy and satisfying to melee kill enemies, but there are few situations where you are allowed that. Easier to take out commanders before they call reinformcement, but you can't stealth kill tougher enemies and then you just position to prepare for big fight. It's kinda weak by itself though too. It may get old and there is supposedly-pro-stealth chapter with melee-only enemies who are more fun and easy to melee straight on. Also, people silently insta-dieing because a knife landed on a heel of a shiny boot are still hiralious.  Then it can be off to a straight-on shoot-em-all style. There is a huge variety of retro-futurustic weapons, all of which get upgraded slowly through the game. Yep, progress kept in global profile. You can also dual-wield two of same weapons, increasing your firepower. Can switch modes of each weapon individually. And game doesn't rely heavily on iron sight, so it's awesome.  But as game comes closer to the end, you will meet a bunch of tougher enemies, who have tons of health and will rip you apart at closer range. I also should note that levels, while aren't exploration maze, albeit still have secrets, have more than one way for a firefights, so you can flank. Or be forced to be more dynamic by tough enemies, as you have to move before getting into their death range. And thankfully, is has enough firefights that last a while. And not only that, but game has interesting first-person cover system. You hold down the button and can either lean left or right, or peek up above the cover, or even lay down to shoot some boots.  Health system is another thing that I find incredible. As you know, Wolfenstein are one of those hitscan-abuse games, barely any projectiles to avoid. And it's not fully about stealth either. So that makes fully traditional points health system fit badly, since you can't avoid random bullets. Regenarating health is better, but it allows you to fully recharge by hiding around cover. So developers used a combination of those. You see, health system can be divided into sections by 20 points each, which can regenerate. So if you got 33, then it will come to 40 soon. And I totally dig this system, as it fixed both complaints that I can die anytime by random bullet because I have only 6 HP and can't fix from current position, while also making sure that I still feel that I screwed up if I end up hiding with 20 points, making me scavenge for health packs. Some say that it first was used in older Chronicles of Riddick, but I don't care. What I want is for it to be used in more hitscan-heavy games like this. So yay for developers for using this one!  And I also should note how awesome this game is in audio-visual part. The art-style, with help of high production and some good game engine, as well as masterful usage of haze/fog and lighting, delivers some amazing vista that look like a concept art that came alive. Music, while used cinematically, meaning that there are silent and simplistic parts, still sets off great different moods and helps the experience. Like, get to final level and see and hear for yourself. Not to mentioning that there are enough variety and satisfying cutscenes to keep you interested and beat the game on a single breath.  There are also few more small details, like you can cut fences and special metal covers with your laser weapon or ability to pull the turret off the place, though you will have to either recharge it if you run out of ammo by placing it back, or just abandon it later.  You also can't help but to feel that developers really wanted to potray Blazkowich as tough as he is during gameplay itself. Probably to make you feel badass. This man can survive ten thousands stabs during cutscenes, so much that at some points you may stop beliving.  Wolfenstein New Order is an amazing game that combines the high-quality cinematics with high-quality gameplay, which is something not to be missed. It's also the first Wolfenstein that I can fully call amazing without huge flaw. As far as I am concerned, it's a FPS of the 2014 year, along with Wrack. Beat it at least once. Watch the trailers too, they are awesome.",1,0

But still it lacks bug fixes it requires to be a finished game, whilst more 'content' is added over underlining issues being bandage fixed. The mechanics of the game are poorly thought out and if you want to be competitive you will have to understand the 'prediction system' in the game a system that compensates for latency between players and the server and abuse of this mechanic makes the top players the 'best' ontop of stamina management and positioning in fights. The truth is its a greifer game and steam is bringing alot of sheep in so it has injected more life into the game, because the game is so tedius and unpollished the steam charts have shown a decrease of 1000 active players daily down to 500. Were before steam release it was around 200(That is being generous). Not that this game is hard it has a very low skill ceiling and simple combat mechanics, the crafting system is very indepth and time consuming being the real grind of the game. It takes a few days to skill a new character and the meta is constantly shifting due to the devs incompetance to properly decide on the direction they want to take. Along side the player gms who still exist under a veil of lies stating there is no gms/hcs that are allowed to play. It is all deception in order to create the illusion there is no bias wen it comes to the people who run the game. The game has a long history of abuse by the children given power to answer petitions because Starvault can't fund outsourced or payed Game Masters and Councelors they use their comunity as a source instead. Obviously anyone can understand the issue with that. My point being if you want to get a sandbox game to fulfill your desire to full loot people and risk your own loot at the same time, this game might be for you if you can get past the curruption, hackers, duping, annoying bugs that seem so simple to fix but have been in game for over 5 years, the ♥♥♥♥ comunity filled with people who want to play a greifing game competitively then sure maybe this game is for you. I only log into to pvp its all I can enjoy to do but gl getting the resources to support only doing that. You will have to farm tedius unexciting pve content that is lack luster compared to veterans farming spots and never beable to compete with people who have 5 years of experience ontop of nearly unlimited resources.

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"A very nice game. Didn`t have any technical issues, works perfectly(GTX770). But it also has some different sides, that we`ll discuss below: Pluses: 1. 2 big places with wide open space (sands of Afghanistan and jungles of Angola-Zaire border region) 2. Big variety of different weapon 3. Graphics are pretty nice out here. 4. Nice soundtrack, picked up somewhere from the middle of 80s. Minuses: 1. Really bad and unclear story. Only those who played previous games can understand the story and it`s weird 2. The monotony of gameplay. Missions are really very simillar to each other and it`s weird x2 3. Side missions is the worst part of the game. You have a standart list of quests, and when it comes to an end, MGS just gives you a permission to repeat the same mission, that you`ve completed about 15 minutes ago.  ",1,0

292180,X-Plane 10 Global - 64 Bit,"First, this is not a game it is a simulator. Compared to FSX it has better flight dynamics. I have over 10,000 hours in several multi-engine jet aircraft and it has the feel and reaction of the real thing. FSX feels like driving a bus compared to x-plane. ATC is better in FSX and is okay for a simulator. X-plane ATC is so bad I never use it. I plan my routes to include descent and setting myself up for an approach without ATC because it is just unusable and doesn't even come close to the real thing.    Scenery in x-plane is better for atmospheric conditions and the out of the box terrain is comparable to FSX out of the box. FSX does have better add-on scenery available. X-plane surpasses FSX on the actual runway. X-plane runways follow the terrain and are very realistic. FSX has better stock aircraft than x-plane so plan on adding a payware aircraft unless general aviation is your thing.    If checklist are your thing, FSX add-on aircraft like PMDG 737NGX are probably better than many x-plane add-on aircraft from a switchology standpoint. I have the PMDG 737NGX for FSX and the FJS 737-200 for x-plane. Systems functionality is more realistic with the high end FSX add-ons, but x-plane add-ons are comparable and generally cheaper. Cockpit graphics are better in FSX, but x-plane is catching up. Weather conditions more accurately affect the aircraft in x-plane. Try a 30 knot crosswing landing in FSX and x-plane and there is a noticable difference with x-plane being very realistic.  It all depends on the desires of each simer. If you are really into checklist procedures and in depth systems operations then get FSX and pay for a high end add-on like a PMDG aircraft. If flight dynamics and a very realistic feel to the aircraft that is close to the real deal then get x-plane. I prefer x-plane and if it had a decent ATC I would probably uninstall FSX and exclusively go with x-plane. I split time between the 2 right now. Hope this helps anyone trying to make a decision.",1,0

Most of the puzzles and platforming challenges will kill you on your first, second, or even third tries. A game with load times like this should not be having you play trial-by-error. The controls sometimes lag and can result in a quick and frustrating death, especially when you're trying to activate something before zombies can get you, as the window to activate most things is far smaller than it should be.

However, it's still great co-op, and the PC version actually works (thus I can recommend it), none of the probs of it's predecessor. It ran great on my ageing machine of the time, and it has to be said, it does look a lot better than SR2.  If it's cheap I'd recommend it, baring in mind the car physics are rubbish compared to GTAV, but that the co-op is very often more fun than GTAV in my opinion - you don't keep getting passed through various public servers full of 12 year-olds just to have a private game with your friends (that is when you get disconnected or change character - lame game management in GTV). The drop in/drop out campaign from this and SR2 are awesome. Shame about SR4 though, I absolutely hate it. Don't waste your money on the BS DLC stuff though.",1,0

275850,No Man's Sky,"It's breathtaking, enormous, gorgeous and packed with amazing adventures. Problem is, the adventures to be had are so white-washed and thin that everything this game promises only about 50% are truly achievable and remarkable. Crafting is so bland and unremarkable that everything it is now needs to be upgraded, rehabbed and made better by the devs. We, as gamers, need more to chew on. The story is so veil thin and unremarkable that a game of this magnitude absolutely DEMANDS more and much, much better. There are so many 'No's' but also so many 'Yes's' that this game deserves a chance to be made better by the devs. It truly does.    So, what exactly is wrong with this game? I'm sure you've read all the 'haters' reviews. 5 minutes of game time and they're bashing the game because it won't work properly, run properly or even at all. Thing is, Hello Games has even stated publicly that over 1/3 of all the tickets inputted into their ticket system have well BELOW the marked specs for the game. BELOW the specs. Head scratcher? Nah? Common ♥♥♥♥ing sense. Listen, if you're pc or laptop does NOT meet the specs, don't complain when it doesn't run properly. Period. That's common ♥♥♥♥ing sense.    What else is wrong? Well, travel is fantastic. Exhilarating even at times. There's a few things that annoy me personally. One, the distance from entering a planet's stratosphere to meeting the ground takes a whopping 30 seconds, if that. I KNOW this game isn't based on realism, but c'mon. From outerspace to ground in less than 30 seconds is not 'believable'. Equipment degradation happens way to quick. Personally, your life support shouldn't need 'fixed' every minute. Makes no sense. These ♥♥♥♥ing drones. Seriously. If you happen to be extracting minerals and one of these ♥♥♥♥ers happens to come too close it'll set off the whole bunch of em against you. While easy at first, the fact you can visit planets that you will get swarmed in 30 seconds by a dozen or so. Just, not fair. Also, what is their purpose? Why are they even scanning everything that you seem to want to extract?   There's no real cement to the story. No real reason you seem to want to travel, to extract, to help. We get some written dialogue, no spoken. Even aliens don't really beep or moan or anything. You get written 'dialogue' pertaining to the alien thoughts and spoken word. While I do like the fact you can 'learn' the language it takes a LOT of time to know enough words to understand even 1 alien. Needs some work to make a little better.     All in all, there are probably too many things to nitpick about. The game does a LOT right. It really does. Travel, the many, many accessible upgrades you'll get for your mining tool and ship. It all adds up to a lot of fun. We need more and a lot different randomizations for each planet and camps. Too many look identical in their make-up. Aliens all look the same. 'Puzzles', ie, random objects you need to solve in order to accomplish some kind of goal are entirely all too easy. They're also all the exact same in the end. You have, maybe half a dozen or so random puzzles you'll have to solve over and over and over again. Needs more randomization and some harder puzzles implemented.    The game looks gorgeous. There's some really annoying pop-in that happens and no amount of graphical distance spacing seems to help. I believe it's the tech and NOT a GPU intensive job. The tech is just making assumptions based on your distance from the objects and THIS needs fixed as well. Badly. It happens ALL THE TIME. You'll notice it. It doesn't neccessarily take away from the immersion but it can be annoying when you're playing with everything on 'high' and nothing helps. While the game looks amazing at times, stupid things that people like to see are not available. You're just a floating arm. Looking down reveals you have no legs. Getting in and out of the cockpit could have a really cool cut scene that can happen showing your entire body. It does not. In fact, you don't even get to pick if you're a man or a woman. You're just a human, I'm assuming.    Sound design is wonderful but can be weird at times. You might notice some sound 'lag' when shooting asteroids or whatnot. It rarely happens, but again, should be fixed.    The game NEEDS some kind of mapping allowable while you're adventuring on a planet. That would be handy dandy. Star maps are okay but can get tedious accessing and trying to figure out where you're going because it doesn't auto align itself.    All in all, it's a good game that can be great. If the devs really follow through and fix what's missing and/or broken this will evolve into an epic space/adventure sim that will just OWN the genre.",1,0

This game is pretty addicting.  The free roam in space, colonizing and defending planets. Every game you make is different even if you use the same map over and over. I recommend this game to anyone who likes space combat sims. Although the graphics are not that great still you get hooked. You can play this game like it was 1993 when you had those endless DOS games where it took you months to complete. Exact same story here, you can play months on huge maps and still you haven't completed a map. Just try it and see if you are convinced.

49520,Borderlands 2,"Borderlands 2 was a game that I tried to really like, but to be honest I can't really recommend. It suffers the same problem vanilla Diablo 3 had in regards to difficulty where you had to play through the game to unlock harder difficulties and I remember you had to purchase DLC packs and level caps to get new, better weapons.  On harder difficulties enemies became absolute bullet sponges that took forever to kill. Even as a Gunzerker I was frequently running out of ammo to kill basic enemies and mobs. This is probably the worst instance of grind in a game I have ever played through.  Even some of the DLC is not enjoyable. Mr. Torgues and Tiny Tina's were both funny and memorable and the latter had the added extra of making Tina less annoying and more likeable, but I don't think it's really enough to save the other packs from being unimpressive and forgettable.  If you can get the game, season pass, and new characters for maybe less than 20 bucks it might be worth it for a playthrough or two. Even with the sometimes lackluster, maymay filled writing you can find enjoyment. But unless you're an avid BL fan, you can skip this and find another shooter worth your time and money.",-1,1

310950,Street Fighter V,"Capcom's 30 year history of the masterpiece, turns into complete rubbish.  All old legendary game franchises has and had some 'death point' on their lifetime. Duke Nukem, Silent Hill, Resident Evil, C&amp;Q, Medal Of Honor, they all had the games that hit the finishing blow to them. And sadly, very sadly, as a Street Fighter Veteran since my childhood, As a guy who gave over 4000 hours to Street Fighter 4 Series, this game is very very close to share the same fate.   Yesterday, when i was seeing this kind of comments, i was telling 'this guys are stupid this game just came out just give it a time already!' 'But after putting much hours and seeing the overwhelmingly awful situation of the game, few days is definitely not enough to put this abomination together.   This unfinished rubbish, had everything better in BETA, I'm sorry not Beta FOUR god damn diffrent Betas plus some hidden short-time ones and they worked better than the full version. This is a huge disrespect, and whats huger is the price of the game. 50$ for a game that has poorer quality and worse developers than free2play games and companies. I wish it was only the technical issue, but everything, just every aspect of the game smells like low-budget, carelesly done crap.  ENough of the exaggurated info, lets get to the mistakes of the game. First of all, currently it doesnt work, nothing, just nothing works right now. And thats not even the main issue, most of the techincal issues about servers can be fixed within a days. There are also frame rate issues, OFFLINE INPUT DELAY, No V-Sync disabling options. Stuttering, Teleportations, and every god damn graphic issues you can imagine. But thats not just it! The game itself is 'bad'. Even without the techincal issues. I'm not talking about mechanics, I'm talking about the 'FULL GAME' First of all, 'Capcom Fighters Network' is a complete joke. Horrible design, annoying menu controls, and limited options is just the small part of its faults. So you want to invite your friend to the game and play with him ? If it was SFIV you click 'invite' via Steam. But this, this feels like quantum physics to solve. First of all you click to causla match because you want to play 1vs1 with a friend, and no. It isnt there its just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ option to find random people randomly. Then without hope i clicked VERSUS because maybe they put it in there and no, its just a classic offline 1v1. Then i said ok lets create a lobby, because lobbies were actually working yesteday, and now they don't. So i created a lobby, and looked at the screen there are no options to invite, looked agsain with higer attention and NO!, there isnt one. i just pressed random buttons on my controller repeadetly and a very small sub menu appeared in the lower left of the screen called press (Y) for Lounge Options. and clicked it and i saw the 'Invite' button. I was happy and i clicked to it, and i had no friends on the list. Because the game uses it's AMAZING (!) CFN system. Then i returned to the menu to go on a new amazing adventure! Adding a friend! Of course there isnt anything like this on the menu, whats fun with easy menu controls? You must click to CFN and you search for Rivals, you ASK your friend for their SFV tag, and add them to FAVORITES awkwardly. There are also no chat options so its a silent game, even no microphone! No voice chat, because it just distracts you from the heart of the battle right? And i invited my friend, oops invited my favourite to the game and my lobbyt gets shut down. So CFN system is really amazing! When you are in middle of a ranked game a distracting huge pop up says 'This guy wants to fight with you! and when you return to menu there isnt anything, any exclamation marks. any pending invites so you must go on another adventure to find out. And you find out there is a notification board, hidden in the sub menu in the right (without an excalamation mark on the top of it) and you join the game that way!   The story mode is also amazing, i bet they also thought for 4 year old children to enjoy the game because stories are made of pictures that looks like children's coloring books. 3 picture for 100 speaking lines and you just hit a 1 round training dummy 3 times to complete amazingly deep storyline(!) for each character. So, isnt it amazing. And there is also an amazing survival mode in year 2016! Yaay! Bot punching for hours for some good old fight money!   ANyways lets speak about game quality cand competitive multiplayer. We have a full roster of SIXTEEN characters. It's a great number. Who needs lots of characters anyway you should main just one to compete better(!). Look at tekken TT2, it got released with 60 characters and only 16 is being played in competitive scene. So they felt like it's a waste of effort. Lets get their 50$ for nothing! Graphics are not 'stunning' its just mediocre. Some good, some bad. Music is the same, some good, some boring. Nothing like past games though. Graphics and Music was always amazing and top notch in past games. I like the ranked system, i like unique character design and V skills and thats all. Thats all i like. I hate the easiest combo system ever designed for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3 year olds to learn and master. When i make the hardest combos in he game it feels like jabbing the opponent, i dont feel proud, i dont get hyped. It's just too simple. I hate the 50/50 situations on wake up, I hate the lack of kara's, option selects. I hate the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly missing juggles and lots of special moves and normals which half of it has weird not-fitting hitboxes.  My last wish for capcom is shutting down the game and delay it to the june. Fixing the issues and balancing the stupitidies, because this game had an amazing potential.  ",-1,1
331470,Everlasting Summer,"I'm going to be very kind with this title since it is free and I know some of it's messy development story. You can forgive the art style which goes from good to more like someone tossed in the concept art pieces and called it a day. Characters are interesting enough and it doesn't have a heavy handed Soviet storyline which I part suspected. Actually rather ignores a lot of that and just uses the Soviet era as a setting. Characters come off a bit better because of it.  However, I can't be totally kind with the writing. The first major offense is the emotional attachment between the characters. Aside from Slavya who is pretty much the poster girl for the game, and Lena who clearly is pegged as the second choice girl to Slavya, the MC (main character) is pretty much at odds with the others. The problem is the writing team focused too hard on making the story neutral and I suspect they didn't really develop the other character's as heroines till later. Probably only had 2 pegged for the initial project.  Up until day 6, the story you can consider is in neutral arc. It's literally harem mode as all these girls throw themselves at the MC but no one really gets picked. What this causes is moments where there is clearly some good moments between the MC and one of the heroine, then he's back to being slug boy and wanting nothing to do with anyone.  His character is probably the biggest hinderance to the story as he's just not believable at times. Specially his reactions. Again this is mostly due to the length of the neutral segment of the story. By the time the individual stories start coming forward, he comes off as just merely going with the flow and not really caring.   There are other weaknesses in some of the characters. One seems to have multiple personalities which doesn't come out till the end and makes you wonder why the MC is willing to overlook the fact she is borderline homicidal. She even gets probably the best ending of them all as the others have rather cookie cutter endings.  Really a lot of this could have been written better but I think what you'll see here is complications from design decisions which just snowball later. It won't be Katawa Shoujo. Not by a long shot. Even the weakest story arcs of Katawa will shine brighter than this. But it's not a bad use of time. I'm certainly glad to have played this.  All in all, it really is a mixed bag. From a story perspective I'd maybe give it a 7/10 tops. Adding in the art issues and general quirks from it's development, probably a 6/10 at best. I hope for the future sequel as I hope they learned a lot from this game's development. But we'll see.",1,0

I felt like I was closing in on the finale after 6 hrs of play, which turned out to be wrong as more game play was revealed. I do not have a grasp for the companions I bring along on missions so I hope they allow that to develop more as it goes on. They are simply mercenaries with little to no character developed through the battles. Those points aside, Shadowrun Returns is worth playing though as it is fun and draws you into the cyberpunk/mystic future that the art and turn based play style have created.",1,0

108710,Alan Wake,"This game excels in many ways and in short -- you should buy it.  Most captivating is the atmosphere. This game was developed by Microsoft and it is very apparent that they took inspiration from their home state of Washington. The vast temperate rain forests containing abundant lakes coupled with cloudy skies truly strengthen the setting. Taking on a vibe of mystery and horror the story of Alan Wake is also quite interesting. I'll be honest I mostly play games for the story much like one would read a book or watch a movie. In this regard Alan Wake was incredibly fun but at times I also found myself 'grinding' through the game in a sense, wishing to simply continue the story. I suffered from one or two 'rage quit' moments but ultimately pressed on and I am glad I did. Another refreshing strength of this game is the unique gameplay. The combination of the flashlight weaponry with unique puzzles and challenges is very refreshing compared to other games and made the game less monotonous. All in all, while not perfect, Alan Wake is a very enjoyable game and everyone should play through it once.",1,0

409710,BioShock Remastered,"Some in game images I took are over at  www.pixelcore.co.uk   If you're reading this and you own either Bioshock or Bioshock 2 then great news! Bioshock Remastered should now be in your steam account.  It's probably a good idea that you know my PC set up before we continue so you can get an idea of how your PC will handle the game and for the purpose of this, I'll be taking a look at the first Bioshock as that's the oldest and because it's my favourite.  PC Specs:  CPU: i7 5930K 6-Core  Motherboard: MSI X99S Gaming 7  RAM: Crucial Ballistix DDR4 32GB  GPU: GTX 980 Ti  Now lets begin!  First of all, those silly devs forgot to put mouse control in the menus and instead, opted for arrow key control. Great! Good start. Is it 2016?  Anyway, let's go into the menu and see how many great options there are.  Basic menu options. This this is disappointing, especially to not even see the same options that we get in Bioshock Infinite. Also no borderless windowed mode, that's a killer. This is the level of control I expect to see from an XBLA indie game. Not to worry, onto playing the game!  As to be expected, the game runs great on my machine. No flickering, no hitching and no FPS drops to be seen anywhere. The game looks good and seems to have had that smudge effect removed from the original, while still retaining the Bioshock atmosphere we know and love.  You can see in the image above that everything looks much sharper and clearer than it did before. It makes an already great game just a bit more playable for the gamers out there who can't stand outdated graphics. Let me make this clear though, this is not a complete overhaul and is a touch up at best. I can't complain too much because 2K gave the collection to everyone for free on PC, and I've had no performance issues since booting up the game.  If you want to relive a classic or haven't played a Bioshock game before, then Bioshock Remastered is an excellent way to get started. Just don't expect too much. If you want to take a look at what a complete overhaul looks like, have a look at Systemshock and the great the work the team are doing on that game.  Here's a few more screenshots for you to take a look at! Bioshock Remastered is out on PC, Xbox One and PS4 right now.",1,0

429680,Spellweaver,"Summary:  A nice mix of what is good about Hearthstone and Magic. The main draw for me personally is that it fixes what I dislike most about magic oustide of the massive money investment you need to play Magic. It accelerates acquizition of land cards or in this game, shrines. If you've ever hated not drawing lands Spellweaver has a system in which you can shuffle one card of your choice back into the deck and look at the top 5 cards of your deck, if any are shrines(lands) you can add that to your hand. That and the fact that the shrines are more mulilayered, some giving you new hero powers for example and the fact that you can choose whether you want to increase your mana(which is identical to HS in use but not in how you acquire it) or power level which is a flat resource that never depletes but is required to play certain cards.  So for me that's huge, I hated having to draw land cards in the f2p versions of Magic and potentially not being able to play anything. This keeps the game fun and fast without the need for cards that ramp up your lands like in Magic.   Outside of that, the game is very much like Magic except with the addition of the mechanic I listed and the hero power mechanics, which change the game very drastically. The card art and certain card designs, effects and archetypes are very familiar if you play Magic. But it's unique enough to not feel like a complete copy. There are more complex mechanics like the support line and the speed mechanic and the way in which you block is a bit different than Magic as well. So don't be fooled by it's appearance. There's a lot to enjoy here and a lot of fun unique mechanics to learn.  CONS:  Crafting/Disenchanting  My main issue with the game right now is the way in which you disenchant cards to craft new ones. You use shrines as currencies, which if you read what I said before are lands. The problem in this game is you need to specifically have shrines for the color in which you are crafting for. And not just that, you need to have at least 20 shrines at all times, so you can't disenchant below that. Why does this matter? Well, at the start you have 0 shrines, you get 20 from the starter decks. So what this means is, you need to either one disenchant a lot of cards of a certain color to first meet the 20 shrine limit before you can even start earning shrines that will go towards disenchanting OR you have to unlock the starter deck for each class which costs 40k gold, which is about 3 packs(it's quite a lot). You can get starter decks by leveling up but it will take a lot of hours to do this. So realistically you'll be spending either a lot of time or potentially money to get enough shrines to make cards you want. Which is nothing new, but the way in which you do it in Spellweaver is very unintuitive. Rather than have a flat rate, it's set up behind this 20 shrine minimum and not just that you have to then transfer shrines from different colors over to the color in which you want to create a card for, but not just that, it taxes you shrines, so the exchange rate isn't even a 1-1 ratio. Imagine in HS if you disenchanted a Hunter card but then had to transfer the dust to Mage first before being able to use it for a Mage card of your choice, but that 100 dust you got from disenchanting got reduced to 80. You'd be ♥♥♥♥♥♥.   Art, UI and Game Options  So if you've taken a second to look at the gameplay, you'll notice right off the bat that this game does not have the most unique appearance. It's card art looks very similar to Magic, it's main menu while efficient in what it does is bland. Even the name isn't interesting. It comes off too much like a Magic clone, and that will hurt it imo. It could really use a rehaul in a lot of areas to help give it it's own unique style that it really needs. The game options however are bare bones, the game is locked at 30 fps and while there is a windowed mode, you cannot adjust the resolution of it, so you'll be stuck with an awkward and ugly game window if you choose to go that route while playing. The 30 fps isn't too bad, you'll get used to it but if you go from other TCGs that run higher you might be annoyed by it.  Conclusion:  Overall though, it's a very good game. Fixes thing you might dislike from other TCGs and innovates with it's own twists. The areas in which it lacks while very important can be adjusted and overcome. The core gameplay is great and fills a solid niche between Magic and Hearthstone.",1,0

239140,Dying Light,"It may be squalid and zombie-infested, but Dying Light's city of Harran isn't a depressing wasteland – it's a vibrant, ambitious, open-world playground. Here, buildings are for climbing, the undead are there to be destroyed in creative ways, and there's always something interesting to be discovered nearby. It takes a while for that to become clear, though; at first, you might even think Dying Light is really about running scared from mobs of seemingly unconquerable zombies, who can quickly drain your stamina and wear out your improvised weapons. Don't be fooled.Yes, it's a struggle to survive in Dying Light's early hours. Combat is initially clumsy, with the diverse and deadly zombies able to soak up a disturbing amount of punishment before they die for good. Jumping – which is unintuitively mapped to shoulder buttons on consoles – can take a while to get used to. Getting mobbed is usually a death sentence. So is attracting the attention of the much more dangerous things that come out when daytime dynamically gives way to night, at which point the focus shifts to tense stealth — or, if you’re discovered, an adrenaline-pumping sprint for the nearest safe point.Before long, though, you'll build up a skill set that turns your rotting foes into objects of fun, letting you vault across their shoulders, quickly slice them apart with dramatic slow-motion kills, or trick them into gathering around explosives before blasting them all into the sky. Even nighttime becomes an opportunity to raise skills faster thanks to increased XP gain, rather than a period of sheer terror. It all feels great, too; once you adjust to the controls, Dying Light's first-person parkour becomes natural and fluid, and weaving high-speed paths through its decaying slums and picturesque old-world buildings is so much fun that I almost don't hate the lack of a fast-travel option. Combat, meanwhile, gets increasingly satisfying, although it never quite loses its awkwardness. Even when expertly shredding zombies with elementally charged tools of death I built myself, strikes are still heavy and clumsy. And while the guns you'll find later can pop heads from a distance, their low rate of fire and zombie-attracting noise makes them more of an occasional quick fix than a game-changing weapon. To Dying Light's credit, though, your adversaries are surprisingly capable; while the rank-and-file Biters are dumb and fun to manipulate, more powerful enemies – like the quick, agile Virals – are formidable close-quarters opponents, ducking your strikes and sidestepping out of your reach while looking for an opening to attack. Hostile bandits are even deadlier, able to dodge and block at close quarters, throw knives from a distance, and use guns and group tactics to kill you if you get overconfident.",1,0

The writing is very good as well, with elements of humor throughout. The game is pretty linear, but that's not exactly bad. The only fault I can find is the fights are perhaps a bit too difficult. Many fights might come down to who gets the last hit in. There are times you might think a fight is impossible, only to discover there is another room where you can fight 1-2 more batches of monsters, and they drop a weapon or level up one of your guys, and that tiny edge is what you needed to make it through the next fight. Some of the encounters take thought, and require a solution you would not normally think of, forcing you to figure out an unorthodox solution. All-in-all, I think this is a good game.",1,0

327880,Sublevel Zero Redux,"Amazing game. Brings back fond memories of the mechanics of the Descent series (before Freespace), but with it's own unique take on the 6DoF (6 degrees of freedom) genre. The feel of the movement and combat is just right, and the game strikes a perfect balance of high speed action and item/resource management of an roguelike rpg. The game rewards skill greatly, and encourages you to conserve your ammo and use each of the many weapon types to their maximum effectiveness. Repair kits are uncommon, and take up vital (and limited) inventory space, so crucial decisions must be made about what to keep and what to leave behind. There is also a surprisingly deep crafting element, allowing you to combine weapons, hulls, and ship components to create new ones. These items, especially weapons and hulls, can dramatically alter your playstyle.  There are many types of weapons of various rarities, each with their mechanics, playstyles, and ammo types. There are ballistic (shotguns, minguns, railguns, etc), plasma (big 'ol energy 'globs', flamethrower) , energy (lasers, bolts), missiles (dumbfire, homing, 'grenades', etc), 'dart' (wolfpack missiles, cluster rockets, swarms), and 'advanced' (gravity missiles, crazy stuff). Each weapon rolls various modifiers when it drops, affecting its properties damage, rate, accuracy, etc). All of the weapons can also be crafted with others to form new ones, though the more powerful 'recipes' require that you unlock/find a blueprint first. Crafted weapons are often quite different, especially mechanically, from their 'ingredients'. This leads to a wide diversisty of emergent playstyles depending on what weapons you are able to craft. Also, crafted weapons are affected by the modifiers of its ingredients, so holding onto early drops with 'great stats' is a viable decision if you want to craft something awesome later on.  There are also several different types of ship hulls and components. Like weapons, these roll various prefixes which affect their stats (speed, boot, ramming damage, etc). Hulls can also significantly affect your armor, primary, and secondary weapon capacity. Completely new additional ships can also be unlocked by completing various tasks over the course of your playthroughs.  The graphics are excellent for this game. The corridors and tunnels look great, and the action is quite smooth. The lighting effect on weapons fire makes tracking enemy projectiles easy (though evading all of them may be another thing altogether). There are many interesting enemy designs, with different, color-coded variations of them equiped with different weapons. The color coding makes it easy to identify at a glance which variant you are facing, which is crucial when dealing with them.  The sound effects and music are great. The soundtrack in particular is excellent. The composer is currently offering his album on bandcamp, which I happily purchased recently. It is a combination of pulse pounding electronic, chiptune, and orchestra. Each track is fantastic in its own right, and is dynamically altered depending on the situation (exploring, fighting, etc). I espeically like the track 'Chain Reaction' when it shifts to the base/synth heavy 'combat' variation. Do yourself a favor and by his soundtrack!  This game is a must have for anyone who enjoys a 6DoF shooter, in the likes of Descent or Forsaken. It is not a 'Descent/Forsaken Clone' nor does it claim to be. It *IS* an amazing 6DoF game with its own unique style and gameplay mechanics that stands out as an excellent example of this genre in its own right.  Final verdict: Buy This Already! / 10",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"When I first heard of No Man's Sky it was way back when Elite Dangerous was in its first year and my friend at the time was raving about how No Man's would be WAY better and how he would wait till its release instead of joining me in Elite: Dangerous. Weeeeelllllllllll....Elite is still a far supierior game, WITH Multiplayer and players affect how the direction of the game pans and and in a way the story plot. The price tage of Elite and all its expansions, if your wait for the initial price to drop can all be obtained for under $30 each, is still cheaper than No Man's.  Pros: Great graphics, amazing visuals and colors, nice crafting system. Gek perfumed farts.  Cons: Crappy flight controlls on planet surface, resource collection quickly becomes a grindfest, almost all animals are hideous Spoor abominations, lack of enemy diversity becomes apparent, space combat blows, next to no game plot,   Naming things becomes meaningless as no other player will ever see your planet named LSD; where acid rains constantly, Acidillos roam the land while Rave Worms travel in packs making thier mating calls and Magic Mushrooms grow in abundance. For the same reason Tony G's Traders will never be recognized as a galatic spanning franchise in-game (I renamed every trading postin honor of Tony G).   Maby the single player nature of the game is due to the fact that Hello games copped out on buying servers and to save face said there was still a chance (although infintismal) of meeting another player in-game.  For $60 AUS you could get a lot of things that leave a longer lasting, and more positive memory, than this game has laft; A night out with your friends, taking your parents out to dinner, a 1 foot joint to celebrate 420 Day, a new set of tyers for your bicycle, a 50gram pouch of tobacco, 10-20 humble bundles of games, or a birthday present for your girlfriend/boyfriend.  No Man's Sky is as vast as an ocean and as deep as a glass of water. Its name is very apt as in the end not a single man (or woman) will be flying the skies of this game.",-1,1

268500,XCOM 2,"2 hours in and i can already review this BECAUSE ALL THE BAD REVIEWS ARE FOR THE SAME REASON   1) 20 hours in game glitches and you lose your crew 20 hours wasted! BLah blAh blah  Don't play the game on IRONMAN SETTING YET!!! Imagine trying to play fallout 4 with only autosaves o.O  Its new obviously there are going to be bugs. And obviously at times a bug is going to cost you, Having a save to go back to to overcome a bug is not save scumming it is common sense. Any bad review because they lost 'all their work' 20 hours could have easily been expected if you did not run ironman on firstplaythought, just resist the save scum urge if you really wish.  2) THE RNG IS SO BROKEN BLAH BLAH  The game rolls the dice for each squad mate at the START of a turn between 1-100, if you hit chance exceeds roll it hits, so at times no matter how many times you reload the autosave and try it differently if the roll was 100 you are not going to hit, and at time no matter how remote and how you do it differently if the roll was 1 you will not. This gives the appearance of broken rng to dumb people because they can't comprehend the roll is not made when you select 'fire'  ^ With all these bad reviews gone(80% of them) it leaves just the complaints of performance and forced turn timer  For performance: yes it cannt justify the resources the game is taking, but on med-high settings i am running smooth and will increase fps in future patches im sure definatly above the playable threshold so far for me  For the force timer: Don't listen to these people they don't know what they are talking about, the game is ACTUALLY hard now where as in xcom EU and vanilla overwatched everything with op squad was good game on hardest settings. There is an actual tactical challange now and it fits right with the story now that aliens control earth.  Overall: Still xcom, still best turned based tactical strategy around, publisher is worth supporting, yes it would be nice if performance was more optimized and few less bugs on day 1 but this will be fixed, can easily see spending wayyyy too much time on this game, I'd still advise getting it on sale at this point however as you may be able to get its for 40$ ish soon or if you look around.",1,0

Pros: Guns are not very rare, so you're not kicked out of PvP for long. Pros: Character is shared across servers. Pros: You game experience for kills, and experience yields real changes in your playing. Including new skills.  Cons: Not a whole lot of content of weapons. Cons: The game is quite challenging in all aspects without friends. Cons: Scavenging becomes very hard with such a hostile enviroment.  All in all, I rate this a 6/10.

226840,Age of Wonders III,"In this game, the main premise is a large scale rivalry between powerful mages with varying specializations and studies, who bend cities by their will toward good, evil, or whatever.  Gameplay is reminiscent mostly of Heroes of Might and Magic, in a good way. This is a 4X game with an especially strong emphasis on exploration and extermination, with heroes who go questing, conquering, leveling up, and looting for themselves and their empire. Campaign actions are made on a high-level campaign map. Battles play out on a lower-level map in a tactical turn-based manner, taking into account the terrain and structures of the tile on the campaign map. Both maps use hexagonal tiles. Armies (unit stacks) are composed of up to six units. In a battle, all adjacent armies participate. In some ways, this approach to combat feels like a middle ground between Civilization and Total War.  Much of the design is reminiscent of Master of Magic. Cities and units vary according to the class of the player and the race of the inhabitants. There are six classes (arch druid, dreadnought, rogue, sorceror, theocrat, and warlord) and six races (high elf, human, orc, goblin, dwarf, and draconian). The variety is good but not dizzying, with a solid array of standard unit types and a handful of specialists available in any city that has the requisite buildings. Spellcasting plays a major role on the campaign map and in battles. The spells span a wide spectrum from an assortment that is modest in cost and effect to the immensely powerful and expensive high tier. Each school of magic (among air, earth, fire, water, creation, and destruction) is distinct, with its own characteristic effects and strategies. The interplay between questing, empire building, warfare, and spellcasting is fun, engaging, and balanced.  Compared to other 4X games, there is a diminished emphasis on exploitation. Rather, the exploitation here is ultimately focused on serving the exploration and extermination. You won't find options for cultural, diplomatic, or economic victories here, and the gameplay options are limited likewise. This is not a game of peace. [edit: Interestingly, Triumph has hinted that this is an area that they will expand in upcoming updates.]  The overall fit and finish is very good, although not without room for improvement. The UI is strongly reminiscent of Civilization V—a good choice of inspiration. Some aspects live up to this standard better than others. There is a Tome of Wonders (akin to Civilopedia), but it's a pain to navigate (no back button?! among other problems), and some of its pages neglect important information. Some stats show breakdowns on hover, as they should, but some breakdowns lack desirable detail, while others are simply omitted. I'm curious to see if any of this improves with ongoing updates.  Unlike Civilization and most other games in the 4X genre, a game of Age of Wonders III at normal pace is significantly shorter. Expect a commitment of three to six afternoons instead of three to six full days. Considering the pesky existence of real life, this is a very desirable trait.  If you like 4X and high fantasy, and you'd like a game that combines the two in a form that's easy to swallow, then this is a great choice.",1,0

I have had games where I died in the first few jumps, and games where I have battled deep in enemy territory, eviscerating the enemy ships before they could even scratch me.

The game is HUGE, of course there's going to be a bit of bugs along the way. The world is gorgeous, quests are actually interesting for most of the time, unlike with others mmos. It feels a bit more like a solo RPG with real players encounters from time to time than a huge coop RPG, though, so don't expect to always be playing with your friends or other people.

108710,Alan Wake,"Alan Wake is one of those games where I'm not sure how to feel about it. It has strengths and weaknesses, but they are extremes.   Pros: Alan Wake draws heavily on ideas from Stephen King novels and is more or less a fan fiction in the form of a video game. As a result, the game has possiblly one of the best plots and stories I've seen in recent memory. Unlike others, the narration style and the manuscript reveals that annoyed some I actually found to be very immersive. Additionally, the environments and atmosphere are incredibly well done, providing the perfect settings for a horror game where constantly moving mists and shadows keep you wondering if something is out there.  Cons: The gameplay is horrible. Not just bad. Horrible. It is painfully repetitive, simple and never really evolves, even at the later stages of the game. I actually physically groaned every time a fight sequence came up because I could feel myself losing interest in the game, in spite of everything it does so well. It is a game would have been better if they just made it a point and click adventure game. Very rarely do I find myself wanting a game to end so I have an excuse to stop playing it. The camera style is over the shoulder and off-angle making moving in the game painfully difficult for no reason and platforming sections needlessly difficult. You will die several times simply because you cannot walk the way you wanted to go. Additionally, the game is suppose to be a horror game, but squanders the incredible environment and story it has by going into slow-motion and zooming in on enemies as soon as they spawn. This pretty much prevents anything from ever sneaking up on you because it gives you so much reaction time. It also reveals all of its major scares ahead of time in the manuscript pages. I'm okay with the reveals because it is part of the genre, but at least hold on to a few of them. Finally, the game combat is just too easy. You constantly swimming in ammo and batteries to the point where you'll pretty much never run out of anything.  Verdict: If you are a fan of Stephen King or you have a bias towards games with good storytelling and writing, then you'll probably find a way to enjoy this game. If you want a game that is fun to play, you don't want this title. Honestly, I played through to the end for the story, but the game felt more like a chore and I didn't enjoy the experience. So recommended with an entire salt shaker.",1,0

It was fairly difficult at first because of having to control two characters at once, but I eventually got the hang of it. Fantastic scenery and character development. I grew to like all of the characters, and even though they weren't speaking the same language as me, I could still understand their troubles by the tones of their voices and their expressions. It had a very good use of interactive environment, and everything seemed to be involved. Beautiful story, and incredible ending. It was very emotional, and everything went by very smoothly. I never experienced a single glitch throughout the entire, short-lived game. It is a very reasonable price for a short game that I will always want more of. Definitely one of the most touching games for me, including its gameplay, storyline, interactions, plot advancement, characters, and controls. This cinematic game will forever stay with me. Thank you for taking the time to read this.  Edit: I will also comment on the soundtrack.

38700,Toki Tori,"If you're looking for a genuinely challenging game of good, clean, puzzle-solving, and no less than roughly a dozen hours worth of play before completion, I sincerely recommend 'Toki Tori.'  In 'Toki Tori,' you play a fun-sized, flightless-jumpless bird, collecting eggs by navigating around platforms, and dodging enemies, utilizing your array of tools to your advantage. The challenge is that not all the tools are available at once, and they have a limited amount of uses, pre-set specifically per level. This knowledge provides clues to achieving your goal, placing you in a sport of trial-and-error until you find a way that works for you.  If practicing puzzles isn't your cup of tea, there isn't much I can recommend here. The game can get slow and sluggish; as more elements get added to levels, the possibilities expand, and you must keep trying similar things in various combinations until you find one that works. If you're akin to puzzle-style experimentation, you've got no problem, because the higher levels especially require tons of patience before you figure out what to do.  The art style of the game is cozily cartoonish; the physical setting and music of changes per level, which doesn't necessarily add to the gameplay, but rather to its warm and friendly vibe. A great (and my favorite) aspect in this game is the Rewind button, allowing you to carefully step back in order to do an alternative action without having to respawn. This makes learning the levels more hands-on, as you can explore a potentially incorrect move without the fear of it breaking your success so far. Furthermore, since there's no time limit, you're free to scout and plan without being pressured.  To label 'Toki Tori' as a simple kid's game (I've seen people do it) is a great injustice to the hours of gruelling, mind-mastering required to be victorious. This game makes me feel SO fulfilled and smart when I figure out how to finish a level. While I consider myself an experienced puzzle gamer, 9 hours in and I've yet to finish Normal mode, and there's still Hard and Bonus to go.  As a whole, there's not a lot of replayability here; once you've done all the modes, it's simply a nice trophy for your achievement cabinet. However, with over 80 levels, and greatly increasing difficulty, a substantial amount of commitment is required to finish the game on your own (No walkthroughs! Like a true puzzle solver!) If you like a cute, quality game that exercises your brain, I say get 'Toki Tori' and experience it for yourself.",1,0

The puzzles in this game aren't too hard but they are very well done to where you do have to sit and think on some of them and not just try to wing it. The voice acting was pretty decent as well and brought the game to life and helped to understand the feeling that was behind the story. The message of the story is well written and you get an inside view of someone going through problems in life and their struggle to overcome them instead of just giving in, and it's done in a way that many can relate too the character in the game even if the problems of the player are not exactly the same the character faces.",1,0

240760,Wasteland 2,This is how RPGs used to feel and despite it's glitches (game breaking in some cases) the journey is well worth and the experience generally satisfying and rewarding. I say this is how RPGs used to feel because this is like old Squaresoft and even capcom with the Breath of fire series of RPGs where you can sit down and get hooked!    THE GOOD   The story is good and engrossing  Love the NPCs and the originallity of some of the factions granted you have generics as well  Love the weapons and combat system    THE BAD  Glitches are numerous and pervasive and can end frustrate if not totally turn you off from the game,1,0

After a day of trying to not strangle one's workies or shoot the manager between the eyes I like to unwind to the happy sounds of broken bones and dismembered corpses this little title provides....  I salute the creators to give us such a violent but peaceful way of dealing with life trials, I prefer napalm but that's a personal choice,hee  Anyway, as reviews I can't find fault, utterly simple (so thats america catered for) and pleasingly violent (rest of the world)   Now to kill lots of stick men in many ways.......oh and do be a darling and buy this.

Things were all fine until a few hours into the game when everything started breaking, coupled with obscene loading times, freezes and crashes, this became unplayable.

The real challenge isn't surviving, oh no, that's easy, it's trying to figure out the backstories and mysteries behind each character before they die. And this game doesn't fail on that. Everything is vague, yet detailed enough to leave you wanting more. Your choices do matter.  To be short; it's a fun game, with simple yet interesting gameplay, an awesome art style, and an intriguing story.  I would certainly reccomend this to anyone who is interested.",1,0

Unfortunately it is unplayable in coop, it frequently crashes, mainly when using teleports in a coop game.

In my opinion this game is unplayable in coop, I think there has been enough tim for bugfixing since May 2013! For me and my friends it was a waste of money.

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"AGATHAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  First Person Medieval combat? Done right? Javelins and quarterstaves? Count me in. Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is a brilliant idea actually done right. Setting: It's 1500. Agatha doesn't like The Mason Order. War! And that's about it. 2 teams of feudal infantry face off in free for all, deathmatch, or objective game modes. Players choose from 4 classes. Vanguard: Polearms and two-handed weapons, meant entirely for brutal banzai charges. Archer: Fires arrows, fights with a wimpy dagger. No armour; dies quickly. (Doesn't wear a Ghillie suit, thank god) Man at Arms: Light and nimble: one sword, one shield fighter. Quick, and lightly armoured, dances around enemies. yooouuuu gguuueeessseeeddd iiiitttttt Knight: BIG. ARMOURED. SLOW. STRONG. BIG SHIELD. BIG AXE. BIGGER SWORD. BIG ARMOUR.  Choose a class, customize his weapon loadout (axes, throwing knives, swords, smoke bombs, pikes, spears, long swords, broad swords, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ swords, maces, mauls. battle axes, little hields, big shields, slings, bows, crossbows, dagggers.) And enter the fray.  Comabt is first person, based off of blocking, and hitting. Blocks, be it with weapon or shield, must be in ther general direction of the opponents attack, the larger the object, the more room for error. Kicks and shield bashes wear down opponents stamina, ad open up opponetns for cheeky stabs. Attacking is based on a directional slash, swing, or stab; all with varying speeds and damages. This simple yet intuitive system creates complex and intense dulas mano-et-mano, as well as hectic stab-fests in large group melees. Arrows must be drawn back and aimed, flails don't give a rip who they hit, and quarterstaves are useless. All together, you get a hectic and distinct melee combat game which can be described in one word:  FUN!  Simple enough, Chivalry rocks. How does it perform? Textures are quite good, though nothing special. Vistas are well lit, well colored, and quite beautiful. Simply; the game looks great. Frame rate is a bit... meh. In accordance to the graphical fidelity, they seem a bit low. Lower end systems should only expect 30 FPS, and even higher ends can barely scrape 60. Combat is intensive, but not THAT much. Regardless, you can run the game fine, even if framerate occasionally gets a bit wierd. (On a GTX 760, I'm averaging 45FPS in heavy combat. I get almost 90FPS in Battlefield 4.) Opponents' limbs fly off spectacularily, blood splatters, and sowrds clang very pleasingly. Furious war crys, crackling fires, painful screams, it all sounds great.  Overall: A quick, brutal, and FUN hack and slash first person melee fighter, with well thought out sword fighting mechanics, tons of weapons, engaging game modes, and a whole lotta happiness for $20. Get it, on sale; $8 is well worth this joyride.",1,0

105600,Terraria,"This is a nice gem of a game that just has me come back again and again.   It is basicly 2D minecraft. You gather materials and build what you want in this virtual Lego land while fighting off monsters that try to eat you along the way. However Terraria does focuse more on the 'action' side of things with tons of weapons and monsters alike along with a great sence of progression to it. The progression is what really sets it apart from other sandboxes with me as it makes you earn new faster tools, stronger weapons, exotic resourses, and amazing NPCs through a mixture of explorations and boss battles. For me this progressions system, though simple, is what has me coming back to this game over minecraft when I'm in the mode for a sandbox game. I'm not saying Terraris is the best sandbox game because its progression system, just that is what I feel sets it apart from the other because of it.",1,0

212480,Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed Collection,This is a great cart racer that surprised me with its quality and variety. It has a huge roster of characters to choose from and the tracks are fantastic as well. Controls are easy to master and the driving feels really smooth. The best part in my opinion is the lack of a 'Catch-up Engine' that can cause more skilled drivers to lose in the Mario Kart series due to a blue shell. Again I highly recommend this title for anyone who enjoys cart racing games or SEGA fans in general.,1,0

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"This game is dreamt up by the creative minds from the newgrounds community, a site of user creative content that came before youtube. I will try not to get to into the storyline (because of the lack of it) but this game has a lot of dark humor. Your main weapon is the tears from your eyes as you try to go deeper and deeper into a cave/hole/hell trying to escape your mom.  The game is about risk and reward and one part old school keyboarding skill. Sorry kids no gamepad. You are often come across a dilemma of which item to bring with you to the lower deeps of the game as you face powerful bosses and miniboss. Should you give up two life hearts for an attack upgrade or spend all your coin in the slot machine in hopes for a good item.   This is a good game and it is very addicting since the map changes every time you play. In life as in games, it is all about risk and rewards and a bit of luck. This is well worth your money.  ",1,0
417860,Emily is Away,"The game is a great throwback to Windows XP and basically sets a feeling later through it of unforgivingness. It basically tells a story on how two best friends later start to fall in love and how they are not ready for a relationship with a ending that can't be changed no matter what happens, There is nothing really bad about the game but let me say what is and isn't good in this game.  Positives + -/+ The games writing is good but nothing really rememberable except the easter egg messages you can get from using the secret profile pictures hidden in the game. + The game is sadly really relateable through a lot of the situations the main charecters have to go through and how it ends. + The game gives off a really nostaligic feeling with profile pictures that can be selected are trending stuff in the years that happen following the story, Like for example the Album cover art for Muse's - Absolution. -/+The game has alot of different choices you can pick from That can change the dialouge greatly but not the ending. -/+ The game is a generally short story that can be read fully once in about 15-30 minutes or so.  Negatives- - You can not at all change the ending of the story whatsoever.  Other then that this game was really relateable for me since i am going through a lot of depressing stuff in my life and a lot of stuff happening in my love life, It can really pull at anyones heartstrings, Even people who never went through stuff like this. I would overall rate the game a 73/100. Its not really rememberable but it really makes you feel bad that some people have to go through stuff like that. I hope you found the reveiw helpful.  ",1,0

Much like Star Citizen, this game is a work in development that a team of 8 people could never possibly deliver everything that they wanted to in the time they were given (unless they were robots and never ate, slept, or had social lives).

411830,SENRAN KAGURA SHINOVI VERSUS,"Disclaimer: As of writing this I have only completed the Gessen Storyline and the Hebijo one (see the first edit at the bottom on what I think of it), yet to do the others.  While on the surface it looks like Anime ♥♥♥♥ The Game, great storywriting and characters as well as great hack and slash gameplay makes Senran Kagura more than just fanservice.  I was surprised when I played through the Gessen campaign. Pleasantly surprised. Having no expectations whatsoever for the game (indeed, I only got this because I wanted a hack and slash and I forgot Dynasty Warriors was on Steam), I was prepared for just some mindless killing and a bit of ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥. I am very picky when it comes to narrative in videogames. It has to grab me from the start, and Senran Kagura did just that. The campaign I played had a dumb as hell plot at first, with the stupidest of reasons for the members of the school to fight each other. However it eventually turns into a touching plot about mentorship, friendship, and the idea of good and evil. The 5 girls in this particular campaign at first look like one dimensional tropes, but you eventually learn of their tragic backstories which may or may not have used what I like to call the Batman Trope (You know what that is, and if you don't, I'm referring to the event that made Bruce Batman to begin with) that led to their current path as shinobis. The beauty of this is that they are characters you feel an attachment to, and enjoy watching grow, you also get to fondle their breasts and put them in the most revealing of outfits. So there's that.  Enough about the story, how is the gameplay? My answer, very good. I can barely manage with Keyboard and mouse although this game is clearly meant to be used by controllers. But I do not have one at present, so I can't really say. Do keep in mind that the keyboard controls are actually alright by itself though (Q is LB and R is RB for menu controls. You're welcome.) The combat is well executed in my opinion with great visual effects, as well as a constant 60 fps despite how busy the screen is. The fanservice here is characters who take too much damage get their clothes ripped. And I have managed once or twice to even get the undies off my opponent if I hit her hard enough, so if you want that kind of fanservice this game has you covered. Edit: The camera is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mess. For all that's holy LOCK ON TO A TARGET ASAP.  Costumes are well designed and are what I can describe as Anita Sarkeesian's worst nightmare. You get all the dlc from the Vita version in this port for free as well.  The lingerie lottery though is a bit of an interesting system. 98 lingerie sets are waiting to be unlocked. To unlock one pay any amount of cash you want; but the more you pay the less chance there is of a repeat. Being a fan of blind bags and TCG booster packs and the thrill of packing something you don't have I love this feature. Though most of the stuff is HIDEOUS imo and of the ones I have I'll only use one or two of those. (also on a side note I have regressed so much that I snark at lingerie designs. What has my life come to.)  The Dressing Room is where you customise your shinobi to look as: a) Hot and sexy as possible b) Cute as possible c) Cool as possible d) Downright hideous And the options can be overwhelming. Once you buy the stuff that is. Schoolgirl outfits, Christmas, nuns, aprons, any kind of fetish you have, there is probably a costume for it (Slight exaggeration, there are only a few fetishes here). Though the fullscreen mode is a tad underwhelming. I like to call this the molestation mode, but all you can do is swipe their clothes off and fondle their breasts. That's it. They do have reactions to your actions, but they all use the same animations anyway. Not like I wanted this part or anything, but it does feel phoned in to me.  In conclusion, is Senran Kagura worth buying? I answer with a hearty YES. At least one of the campaigns is great and at the very least has me interested into playing the rest, and unlocking the rest of the characters. If you don't like fanservice at all this probably isn't for you, because there is A LOT of it. The gameplay is solid, performance is great and the customisation is pretty good as well. I will play the rest of it then update this review.  EDIT 1: I've played the Hebijo campaign. And while it was a bit weaker than the Gessen story, it was still an emotional rollercoaster, dealing with the topics of restoring honour, loyalty, redemption and revenge. The characters' backstories are also well written like the first, but the reason why I say it was weaker than the Gessen story is more of a personal thing, I just successfully predicted the ending of it and how it would pan out, making it less interesting and making me think it as very cliched. Overall though I recommend this part and this game even more, especially if it means that the other 2 campaigns are at least as good as this one. Also Miyabi's side quest is hilarious and I recommend you play it at least ones. Now I'm off to do the Hanzo campaign. I'll be back.",1,0

70,Half-Life,"If you're new to Half Life then go ahead and get Half Life 2, this game is really only for nostalgic purposes for those who played it in its hayday. The graphics are... less than spectacular and the gameplay is... meh. It sort of makes you bored which is defeating the purpose of playing a video game. The game has it's moments but those moments are few and this is a long game. Also, don't worry about getting HL source, they just ported the game over with as little effort as humanly possible, in other words, it's one big pile of glitches and flaws. This game was ahead of IT'S time, but in our time, it's the definition of dated.

I realized a lot 'almost must to do' things in it, lot ppl said the grinding is avg boring. After loads of hrs in diablo, i have to say, grinding in diablo is more boring than in this game. This game is always attractive, it can show new things to do, more exceting planets / stages, more things to grind, much more content.  Many ppl making negative discussion because of the upcoming updates, nerf's, etc. The contra from me is very simple: be happy that devs aren't making the title a p2w game. For me, this is the first free2play title, that can destroy my life completely, because the upcoming new things, and for that, I don't have to pay a greasy cent for it.  The graphics are just growing insane, and the requeriments are pity, fun. I hope it isn't exaggeration if I compare this game to newer titles. It simply looks insane, every simple brush, model is developed insanly. The game sound is always rocks, I usually using 5.1 with a bit bad driver, but simply beats much things. The music gets a bit bored, after loads of hours, but you can fix that by our very loved site named: youtube... :D God bless, the community also have brain here. It is like paradise, when I change here to talk w ppl from cs:go for example.  Simply, this game is badass. The best f2p title out here. Don't be shy to try out this game, even to buy some plat's in it. It worth it.  Absolutely 11/10. Recommended.",1,0

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt," The Witcher 3  has gotten thousands of positive reviews from players, and for good reason too. It is one of the best games I have ever played, without a doubt. I bought  The Witcher 3  for 25 dollars during a Steam sale, and have racked up more than 100 hours in the game. Yeah, it's that good! Everything about  The Witcher 3  is just absolutely amazing. The graphics, the characters, all the different locations, the weapons, the monsters, and the list keeps going on and on! The only complaints I have regarding  The Witcher 3  is that it there are a handful of strange bugs, but the same can honestly be said for any videogame out there. The combat is also a little dull and repetitive, however it is nowhere near being bad enough as to be considered a serious gameplay flaw. The last aspect of the game that annoys me is Roach. Roach is Geralt's horse, and his mechanics tend to be a tad bit wonky at times, for example, a couple of times during the game I'd call Roach over to me, but instead she'd just gallop in the opposite direction. Other than that, I see no major flaws with  The Witcher 3 , and definitely recommend that you buy this game. It is worth every cent, if not more!",1,0

292120,FINAL FANTASY XIII,"The game play is fast paced and somewhat entertaining with it's combo autobattle system. Though after a almost 2 hours of playing I realized all i was doing was hitting 1 button fast while in combat and then using a potion as needed every 9 or 10 fights. This I can look past since final fantasy games for me has always been more about the story that pulls you in and the sense of accomplishment you get when you overcome the various hurdles thrown in your path for character development. This game failed miserably in providing either one of those. This game has you change main characters every 15 to 25 minutes during the first few hours of play. There is no depth, it's full of cliches, and lacks from any sense of cohesion that could possibly be existant in a storyline except for the fact that there is a war going on inside a city somewhere. I'm sure if I devoted my time in reading all of the background articles the game wants you to spend reading I could of gleaned additional information, but I bought this game to be entertained via cinematics and gameplay. I did not want to be informed of key elements of the story via stopping game play to look up the excessive amounts of datalog files...

325610,Total War: ATTILA,"A true love hate relatioship is what I have with this game. It took heavens know how many versions to get a decent political system and I am guessing that took all the imaginitive powers right out of SEGA. They took an unpopular expansion to TWM2 with the Hordes and tried to redo it with the acumulated knowledge of the past failures in this series. The only failure they failed to learn from was creating an AI that doesn't have to cheat to be competitive. It does not follow the same monetary constraints the player is constantly hindered by. Speaking of which; in order to prompt looting and sacking the ridiculous amounts of money needed for conversion, upgrades and forced research unit upgrades are beyond practicality. A few games of 100 turns and you will see that the game was intended to be much longer, was consolidated and ad hoc things added to make up for a lack of design. These are not even relevant to the DLC that has been consistanly piece mealed although included in the original release. This is quick shove of a title onto the shelves with DCL being hopes of improvement for the consumer. I for one have not nor will I ever try DLC content, especially if the base is this flawed.

274170,Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number,"To avoid the impression that I see nothing good in Hotline Miami 2 let's go through the good things first: +New masks!  +New weapons!  +Good soundtrack! (by saying good soundtrack, I mean there were few good tracks tossed in there) +Alex and Ash! Oh.. okay - this one needs some more details. Alex and Ash is a mask choice that lets you play as 2 serial killers at once. One of them - Ash - has a chainsaw and another has a ranged weapon - any ranged weapon you can find on the ground or the standart pistol that Alex gets at the start of the level. Very fun character despite buggy A.I.. Sad thing is that you can't choose any mask for any level you want now - there are different timelines and different roles you must take, so no - you can't go Fists of Fury every single level. And oh yeah - some masks are very unique, but the total number of masks reduced when compared with the first game.  Now let's get to the truth which is difficult to accept - Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is very hard to recommend. Don't get me wrong - this game is not absolutely bad, but it's a sequel to the Hotline: Miami, and as such it's not very fun. Actually it's far from the original Hotline Miami. Developers tried to make this game more realistic and that created a lot of problems. Let's talk about them. Before I start ranting on the combat system, let me tell that this game isn't as fast as the first one. And pacing really kills that mad blood lust of running without any fear of death from the HM1, because sometimes you have to play boring characters in long cover based shootouts (levels with a detective character are especially guilty of this). Other thing I didn't like was the story. It's forgettable and quite frankly, very generic when compared to HM1's 'Acid-Hallucination-Trip with a talking rooster who knows more about what's going on here than you do'.  Okay, let's get down to the combat and level design: -Melee system is now almost useless, because weapon throws aren't as powerful (half of your thrown weapons will drop 10 centimeters away from you and will not reach their target), so you can't stun or kill enemies without firearms as reliably as you could in the original HM. What makes melee even worse is level design. levels are now huge. You can only see very small part of the floor without endangering yourself. You easilly die by the shots that were fired from across the map, where you couldn't even see. Needless to say, levels are now unnecessarily difficult. In the first game every time you died, you died because you made a mistake, made a risky play or just had a bad luck with A.I. (A.I. likes to react to those gunshots that they want to react to). Now you will die much much more and not because of your mistakes - no. You will die as much as it takes for you to remember every single enemy on the map that is 2-3 times bigger than in the previous game. Small rooms and corridors were changed to big open halls and open large rooms full of regular enemies and the larger ones that take ~4 seconds to kill. I know, they were in the first game too, but this time some of them carry automatic rifles and are followed by several soldiers. Also, that room is surrounded by 3 other rooms full of enemies. If you try to kill them all carefully - you will fail. There is little careful planning in this game. That aspect of the game, just like fun melee system, was swapped with running with your gun (or knife if you run out of ammo) from room to room trying to clear them out before you die, so you could catch your breath and thin out enemy numbers as much as possible by luring them to the doorways. Sounds fun? It isn't. It just is not fun, because as soon as you feel that you cleared all the enemies except 1 or 2 that are standing in the room across the corridor you will run there only to get shot in the head by the guy, who was standing under some object that made him almost invisible. You may say that it used to happen in the first Hotline Miami and dying is the part of the game. And you would be correct. You could die by someone you couldn't clearly see and dying was a part of experience - but you have to remember that due to bigger levels, autosaves are now very rare, making you curse this game for killing your character in the cheapest way possible.   When I played the first Hotline Miami, I never raged. For me it was adrenaline fueled run, where every kill was satisfying - especially when going into the room with Fists of fury. In Hotline Miami 2 and its open, large levels it's rarely possible, so prepare to cower behind the corner, fearing for your life when you know the level is about to end, but you must go through the last corridor. And you know that if you slip up just a little bit - click one button a moment too late - you will die and you will have to go through the entire same floor that is big enough to fit 4 floors from HM1. Believe me - at that point no amount of good retro themed soundtracks will help you. Prepare for the endless grinding and a new type of story telling that doesn't really fit the mood of the first game. If you never played Hotline Miami - go buy the first one. If you are not sure if you want buy this game after playing the original - don't bother.  *No, I didn't like this game (but that doesn't mean that you can't like it - if you do, please - enjoy it). Finishing this game for me it was a chore and I would rather eat a bag of caterpillars than play through this drawn out nonsense AGAIN. And not because it's that bad - it's just too long and makes you play as characters you don't even like. On the other hand, caterpillars aren't so bad also - they are rich in proteins.",-1,1

459010,Ghost Town Mine Ride & Shootin' Gallery,"I think a dark ride in VR is really a great concept. Rush of Blood on PSVR really works well, but this game loses me the minute it has me floating around and pulling a trigger to move wherever my head is pointed. I know there are control options, but you just can't avoid the floaty and not well grounded mode of travel. Can we finally stick a fork in that one? No more moving by pulling a trigger? Please?  Still, the opening scenes are nice, the goofy animatronic figures are fun, and the mine cart ride itself is good. This could be a fun diversion if they'd fix how you move when you're out of the cart.  I've got to go lie down with a wet cloth on my forehead now.",-1,0

430960,Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For-,"First off, a disclaimer. I haven't played many visual novels, maybe a couple before this one. As such, I'm not particularly savvy as what makes or breaks these types of games. In fact, I'm not even sure if VNs can be considered games, but that's a discussion for another time.   Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For-  is a remake of a VN that was originally released in Korea in 2010 and was funded via Kickstarter. The story is familiar enough, boy meets (android) girl, is stubbornly reluctant to bond with her at first, but she eventually warms her way into his heart. It reminded me of  Alex+Ada  a bit, seeing as that graphic novel deals with the relationship between a human and an android in a world that is openly hostile to the idea of human-like robots (the world in  Lucy  is less hostile to androids). Unlike  Alex+Ada  though, this one sticks the landing.   There's more going on in the background with the boy's open aversion to androids, what ties into his family, and, naturally, the question of whether a robot can have feelings is explored, leading to comparisons between a robot's programming and a person's upbringing. While I felt like these questions were deftly explored in this context (as well as another one I won't spoil), there were also a few subjects the VN didn't delve into as much as I would've liked. The already-limited interactivity (by my perceived VN standards) compounded this issue and was somewhat frustrating, particularly when placed in a situation where you wanted the character to be given choices to do or say something. After all, the character's behaviour is, at times, difficult to understand, although he's still a (rebellious) teenager so there's that. In exchange, you are offered alternate responses from time to time (a very long time) that have immediate impact (no ramifications that I can see) and unlock achievements in-game. However, it's only the very last dialogue option that alters how the ending plays out.  I can't shake the feeling that  Lucy  would have been better served if it had had more time to expand on its story, but then I remind myself it was a small, Kickstarter-backed, project (with a budget of $14,000), what puts things into perspective. There's only one VA in the game and that's Lucy (Korean and Japanese), the rest of the characters are silent, and they're not that many.  Even so, for all its weaknesses,  Lucy 's story managed to grip me, and move me to the brink of tears through its effective (and borderline criminal) use of dialogue, music, and art. Like  Chuunibyou , it blindsided me with a tonal shift I did not expect. Its narrative is cleverly told, so much so that it merits playing the VN a second time around to fully grasp everything that goes on. Like I said before, there are a couple of endings (actually, more like three) that depend on your last choice, as well as an epilogue that I believe gets rewritten if you unlock all the endings.   It took me about 6 hours to complete, unlocking all achievements and extras. It's a beautifully-told, emotional rollercoaster that stands above its flaws and is definitely worth experiencing. I cannot help but think it pulled some punches due to budget constraints. The KS page does mention it has a streamlined storyline so maybe the original is longer and more comprehensive, but  Lucy -The Eternity She Wished For-  is one VN you should really consider checking out.",1,0

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"This is my personal 2015 game of the year. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt does nearly everything right and is the benchmark of open-world RPGs. The story is excellent and the characters are very interesting. This seems rather rare in the video game industry, considering game developers aren't necessarily the best storytellers or writers. The RPG elements are spectacular, especially the fact that the decisions you make will impact various aspects of the game in different ways. This isn't Telltale bull ♥♥♥♥, this is the real deal. Decisions actually matter in The Witcher 3. The combat is also compelling, especially at the higher difficulties where you really need to plan for battles accordingly. I'm currently on my second runthrough of the game, as there's plenty of replay value here. Hell, just one playthrough is filled with hundreds of hours of content if you choose to explore everything the game has to offer. I'm looking forward to the upcoming expansion as well.  Pros: + Story and characters + Legitimate role-playing elements + Game length + Replayability + Immersive open-world + Compelling combat + Gwent + Expansion potential + Visual fidelity + Optimization + No observable FPS cap + SLI support and great scaling  Cons: - A few bugs here and there  Grade: A",1,0

405640,Pony Island,"Have you ever played Icarus Proudbottom Teaches Typing or Frog Fractions? If not, stop reading and start in on those free flash games; I'll wait.   If you've made it back with your sanity in one piece, or if you've already recovered from losing your mind, you'll probably have noticed the thing those games have in common, which is that they're not exactly what they appear to be. There's a simple mechanic at the core of each game, but the real game is more in the meta commentary about what the game actually is. Games about games, like The Magic Circle, are the decidedly postmodern expression of restless developers who aren't satisfied with the complacent feedback loops and progression curves of modern games, but unless they're literally making a point about the meaninglessness of control (The Stanley Parable), they're best when they actually manage to be a game, even as they deconstruct the entire notion.   Enter Pony Island, a self-described 'suspense puzzle game in disguise,' which basically establishes the game-within-a-game 'Pony Island' as a limbo-like punishment for gamers, a one-trick...well...pony, in which you leap your magical pony/unicorn over gates over and over again until you agree to cede your soul to Lucifer. Pony Island itself, then, which does far more with its retro framing device than You Have to Win the Game or classic Strongbad cartoons, is a game of constant one-upmanship; players 'cheat' at the devil's game, at which point Lucifer changes the code, forcing players to once again hack their way around his conventions. Along the way, the game pulls tricks from Eternal Darkness's book, cleverly attempting to convince players that the game is failing so that players will feel smart when they out-think the devil and progress to the next act.   Except, and here's the really clever part, the heart of the game really is 'Pony Island.' Even though you're aware that this black-and-white wireframe jumping simulator (which eventually gets two upgrades--a laser and wings--that don't add much to the difficulty) is a repetitive anti-game, there's so much framework built into Pony Island itself that you can't help but dive back into the original game. And along the way, you'll even get to see the various iterations of design, from a minimalist text-adventure rendering to a pathetic 3D version, and even a few different skins, including a cheery, full-color 'modern' version. If the goal is simply to not play 'Pony Island,' players can simply quit at any point--Mullens doesn't go so far as to obfuscate your menu options. But because there are hidden 'Pony Island' tickets to collect by completing cryptic tasks--along with equally meaningless Steam achievements--players soldier through the banal hopping in order to see what clever trick comes next.   And there's a lot of content here, from optional tasks like interacting with the desktop's 'Settlers of sAtan' and finding passwords buried in broken option menus, to a series of 'hacking' puzzles that involve placing basic operators into holes in faux-code. It's nothing overly strenuous. Even when loops and splitters are introduced, which calls for a lot of mid-routine micromanagement, the game isn't actually trying to keep the player from winning; it's just trying to convince the player that it is. That's the genius: 'Pony Island' represents every repulsively designed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t time-suck, and Pony Island redeems them all. This even fits into the whole idea of games-as-limbo, in which players can either uselessly throw away their life/time/soul, or can find something of merit within the limns of all that code and thereby make something more of themselves. (It's one of the reasons I turned to criticism in the first place, as actively participating in entertainment is far superior to passively observing it.)   Even though there is no part of the final level that I even remotely enjoy, I couldn't put Pony Island down. It kept wrapping new and surprisingly devious tricks around the same-old-same-old pony express, and the context kept me going. Is there any practical difference between shooting a laser of corrupted binary data at demons or blowing a gust of wind at butterflies that just want to tickle you? No, just as 'Pony Island' itself could be just about any game. What matters, then, is what's around the mechanics, and in that, Pony Island has found gold, and the fact that it doesn't settle for simply being a series of puzzles (like Please, Don't Touch Anything), is what elevates it to a Game That Matters--a game that, in finding both structure and absurdity, succeeds more than Frog Fractions. It's a joke that laughs with you, not at you.",1,0

I got this game because NODE played it a lot, and I thought I would enjoy it myself. I should've known better, however, because I've played both Arma III and CS:GO, and disliked them both.   Now let's get to the good part of this review. This is one of the most realistic shooters I've played. You have to pay attention to all of your surroundings, both visually and audially. You have to be careful yet ready when rounding corners, and you will die very easily. Basically Arma with CoD-sized maps.   Military-style tactical shooters are quite popular nowadays, and if you're into that, get this game now, or wait for it to go on sale, or something. If you're not into that, however, don't think that this is a more univerally-friendly tactical shooter.

You must balance your zone control, weapon upgrades, and skill in order to achieve 100% completion.  This game rocks my socks... 4 times in a row. The music is rock hard, the level design is both spot on mechanically as well as visually. Seriously, the amount of aesthetic diversity in the levels is immense. For those who have this game already, take a close look at the wall in the tree level. There's a pixel matrix style effect that is so subtle I doubt many will notice it but the fact that it's there speaks leaps and bounds about the love and care poured over this game.  Content wise, there's 3 episodes consisting of 5 levels each which will take you about 30 minutes each. But if you actually want to beat them aka 100% them you'll be going back a few times. And then if you really want to push yourself you'll try to 100% the level before you've used all your guys. When you've had enough playing with yourself there are online replays that you can either upload yourself or download to play with. A handful of youtubers have already posted their's up so you'll be able to play alongside them right off the bat.  Downsides? Well even after coming back a few times to up your score, the content feels a little on the short side but in my opinion it's still well worth the $10 price tag because of the immense polish around the game and you'd regret not having played it more than you'll ever regret having spent the money on this rather than something else.  Lastly, a quick note about the VR. If you're a virtual reality developer this is a mandatory buy for you. Buy it and see how to do VR implementation correctly. You don't have to copy it but atleast take a deep look at it and see why it works wonderfully from the autocorrecting camera depending on where you walk with the joystick to the UI they use to the menu and even the level design itself. Look at it and feel intimidated because they're setting a high bar to measure up to.  For those of you who aren't VR developers and wonder if this game is as good without an oculus rift, OF COURSE it isn't! EVERYTHING is better in VR but that doesn't make it a bad game outside of it. In the case of Time Rifters it works just as good and still is worth your time and money.  4/4 Time Lords, would rift again.  Edit: They've just released a daily challenge mode/level editor as a way to offer more content. No excuses now, get buying!",1,0

313140,Blackbay Asylum,It feels like this game is held together by scotchtape and I love it. It has cult hit written all over it. It's like a higher res playstation 1 game.

Or the ever so clever Lazarus (and new medic that drops a rez becon down) exploit where you hang outside the bubble for a few while your team dies to give them all the insta-revive.  All these new patches and the game is still horridly buggy, crashes to desktop quite often (im on a 980gtx), multiple entering and leaving lobby in order to get what you actually want to play or have the game even launch.  With all the bugs involved this game is still great fun but something has to be done about highter teir gameplay involving exploits.",-1,1

113400,APB Reloaded,"GTA Online, basically.  Get this game. Mostly due to the fact that it's free to play, but also because its a solid game. It has a lot in common with the extremely popular GTA franchise, with its massive open-world, car stealing, citizen killing and varied weapon selection, but it obviously lacks a coherent story, since it's mostly a Massively Multiplayer Online game, so if you're looking for story, don't try this game. If you're looking for quick fun, action packed gameplay, try it out.   The customization is INSANE in this, you'll probably spend a few hours just to create your character. And the customization doesnt stop here: weapons, clothing (you can customize the clothings, not just what your character is weraing, meaning you can not only change colors but apply designs, logos, emblems, etc on them) and the many vehicles are 100% customizable (and usually upgradable aswell)  Thanks to its random missions and its nice PVP mode, the replayability is extremely high in this game. Just jump in and play.  Graphics 10/10 Soundtrack 9/10 Replayability 14/15 Gameplay 12/15  Overall - 9/10",1,0
208480,Assassin's Creed® III,"I've seen the same (major) NPC spawned twice in the same room, each with broken animations.   I've had missions where I had to start riots to progress, only to have the rioters spawn two blocks over, and clumped up in such a way that their bodies were intersecting each other, clearly a glitch.   I distinctly remember one of the early missions I did being *entirely* broken, requiring me to restart the game *twice*, just to figure out a way of avoiding the glitch.  Climbing on the outside of a boat, trying to infiltrate it stealthily? Hope you haven't momentarily been glimpsed out of the corner of one guard's eye. It's not enough to actually make him 'alert' to you, but he never seems to become unsuspicious, and worse seems to psychicly know where you're at, even though he can't see you. I had to restart a single mission THIRTY times, just because of this and other glitches.  Glitches aside, the story meanders, and fails to have a cohesive plot. The protagonist is railroaded into one story after another, clearly more to force the plot to carry you along with major historical events (riding the same horse as Paul Revere, for example) rather than writing a good story against the backdrop of the Revolutionary War. The developers clearly had a checklist of major and minor historical figures and events that they wanted to force you into meeting.  The voice acting of the main protagonist is dull. He has two tones: Grey, and loud. The writing is shoddy, with his emotional state seemingly random.   The mechanics are a bit haphazard as well. Hunting? It's never really made clear what that's for. Possibly for (near-pointless) crafting for (absolutely pointless) trading, and the occasional collection quest, but I have tons of materials in my pocket (because infinite pockets) that I'm never quite sure if I'm supposed to be selling or saving, so I've stuck with saving (and ultimately doing nothing with them).   Climbing trees? Dangerous, not actually all that useful (since it slows you down). Same with buildings, at this point. Gone are the days of AC1 and AC2's free running being a transportation method. The roofs of buildings are often too mismatched or unconnected to ever be useful. It was so bad that even the developers realized they needed to shoehorn in an underground maze that unlocks fast travel points around the area, so you can quickly traverse the city without having to deal with actually playing the game to travel.   The maze you unlock fast travel with? Dull. It's atmospheric at first, but after spending 45 mind-numbing minutes exploring ever nook of it just to make sure I missed nothing (there was nothing to miss, only the fast travel points are down there), I now have absolutely no reason to visit it ever again, and regret spending so much time with it.   Side missions? Most of them involve little to no plot. In fact, the vast majority involve finding four people in a city, and pushing a button/key while standing next to them. The most complicated the dialog gets is something like 'Thank you for delivering this'.   I'm around half way through the game, and most of the time I spend playing it has me either rolling my eyes, yawning, or incredibly frustrated.  I'm only playing it because I feel it's necessary to not miss part of the over-arching story. I read books. I *own* books (enough to fill two seven-foot-tall bookshelves). I've been reading my whole life, and sci-fi/fantasy stories are my bread and butter. I can't *not* finish this game before moving on to the (reportedly better) AC4, but I'm NOT enjoying the experience.   The first time I started playing it, I spent 19 hours with it before I gave up. It's the first PC AC game I didn't play through to the end. I'm back now a year and a half later, playing it again, just so I can finish it and move on to the reportedly much better AC4. I'm 48% of the way through, and wish it was already over.  If you're not like me, and can stand to skip this bit of the story (or are willing to let someone else spoil it for you), do not buy this game. If you DO need to buy this game, I recommend spending as little money as possible.",-1,0

374320,DARK SOULS™ III,"* Boring plotwise thus far (Though this may be partially due to some disappointment of mine coming specifically from me really loving Bloodborne's original plot) while shoving the old game's lore in your face with almost no new lore and ♥♥♥♥♥ier item descriptions and all while forgetting what made DS1 so memorable   * You have to play through the Poison Swamp level, the Skeleton Catacombs,    Anor Londo   , and the   Grand Archives    again  * Poise is needlessly cryptic after an unexplained rework that makes it only really effective during certain moves while attacking (to the point that it has no easily noticable effect if you're keeping old poise in mind and the community thought it was turned off for months; if I have made an error in my description of the mechanic, let it be a testament to how non-straightforward poise is now)  * The creation of Vitality (equip load stat) as separate from Stamina seems to have been done to prevent fast rolling with heavy armor from being easily done, but all it does, especially with the decrease in the potency of the effects of Havel's Ring and Ring of Favor, is make fast rolling something no one wants to work towards  * Bows and whips still suck and still have much smaller numbers compared to all the swords and such in the game  * A weapon infusion that makes quality builds (40 STR 40 DEX, with the highest amount of weapon choices and therefore highest build versatility and added damage from dual scaling) even better than they already are continues to make casters seem like a more gimmicky choice (thankfully this is partially mitigated by infusions that scale VERY well with int and faith but they fall into the pit of split damaging)  * Invaders have a hard time random invading without getting ganked to hell and back and the only secure method of red phantom fun is through the soapstone into a SL 120 meta fight club (Reduced health and healing items + higher chance to invade co-oping players + the Blue Anti-invader covenants + seed of a giant tree = ♥♥♥♥ you random Reds)   * The covenants are just the same ones again with no real changes and just one mildly interesting new covenant while continuing Bloodborne's blunder of making the covenants tacked-on and not relevant to much and removing the PvE covenant concept from DS2 (The Solaire-fanboy-fellating Sunbros are back alongside two Forest Hunter covenants and the linked Way of Blue/Blue Sentinels covenant plus the Darkwraiths but under the command of discount Gwynevere, complete with her own sidequest ripped from DS1's Lautrec sidequest, because thinking of a new sideplot is hard! The only really conceptually new covenant is the Mound Makers and even that one needs work to make its covenant interesting or desired. Also, the rewards still suck and they add nothing to the story and are made even more meaningless by just being swappable items.)  Displeased, wouldn't recommend unless you're really thirsty for a live and thriving community to coop and fight club with despite the continued inability of From Software to adequately innovate on and perfect its multiplayer mechanics and the lackluster, overly self-referencial lore, and even then, do your research to see if you'd feel at home after the other Souls games. ",-1,0
268500,XCOM 2,"So, just a quick warning, this is a ramble. An unorganized, opinionated rant. If you want the tl;dr, it's that XCOM 2 is highly moddable, so if there's something you don't like in vanilla, I can gurantee you'll find a mod that fixes it for you. And while the arguement that 'you shouldn't have to mod it to make it better' is definetely valid, I feel like a lot of the complaints are those of personal preference, as opposed to inherent flaws.   ________________________________________________________________________________  There's something I really do have to adress here, and it's that a lot of the negative reviews seem to stem from the idea that this game isn't like the Long War mod from Enemy Unknown/Within, and that the mission timers are too restrictive. Aside from being personal preference, they're valid reasons to dislike XCOM 2, but at the same time, both of those problems can easily be changed with the plethora of mods out their. Hell, the True Concealment mod fixes the timer issue, and I've used it nearly since launch.   It seems like a lot of people were really hoping for this to turn out like Long War, which, for the unfamiliar, was a mod that expanded upon the original game so much that it could've been compared to the Enemy Within expansion. Multiple base assaults and defenses, new UFOs, weapons, classes, skills, missions, enemy types in the form of 'bosses', alien research systems, all contributed to, well, a longer war. Overall, it just added so much to an already great game.  XCOM 2, however, is not Long War. It's not Enemy Unknown or Enemy Within. That might seem like an odd thing to say, but that includes the mindset and strategies you'll be using. You're a guerilla force now. The aliens kicked your ♥♥♥ in the first war. ADVENT is their puppet government, controlling the populaces of several large, advanced cities, with the rest of humanity scattered about in small rural towns and the wilderness. As XCOM, your job is to now get as many resources as you can scrounge up, break down the Elders' plans, and free humanity from these ADVENT-burger-advertising ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.   You don't have the resources of dozens of first world countries to back you up. You don't have highly trained military veterans. What you're working with are scrips and scraps, the bottom of the barrel. You're a resistance, a bunch of rag tag, xenophobic individuals, who really hate those ADVENT burgers. You don't have the luxury of time on missions or on the geoscape. You have the turn timers, and you have the Avatar Project, basically you're doomsday clock. Once that thing is full, you have anywhere from 10 - 20 days to make a dent in their research before you get a classic game over.   XCOM 2 is a game about guerilla warfare. You have to beat the time. Obviously, this won't sit well with some people, and again, I encourage you to take a gander at the modding scene. Aside from the expected gameplay changes, there are some really great quality of life mods, such as Numeric Health Displays and Show Soldier Icons. And don't even get me started on all the soldier customization options. Seriously. In my current campaign, I'm rolling with Cole Train and Mr. Torgue, in addition to various Halo and Titanfall armor pieces. The mods are the established meta of this game, and it's a meta that you can choose.   So, overall, yes. I recommend XCOM 2. It's a fun game, highly customizable, with a lot to do. There are some mods that I'd encourage you to download before even playing the game, or at least to look at them. Grimy's Loot Mod, ADVENT Ascension, Capnbubs Accessories Pack, Free Camera Rotation, any map pack, Free the Hood, Numeric Health Display, Quiet Bradford, and True Concealment are all mods that I use in my current campaign, in addition to a large number of other mods. I'd recommend that you check out the XCOM subreddit and ask some questions if you need any help. Great community.",1,1

340270,TIMEframe,"If there's one thing you'd expect from a 'game' of this nature, it's gorgeous graphics and a wonderful soundtrack. This game most assuredly has both of those. The developers made a very interesting and unconventional decision when they chose to give the world you inhabit (for all of ten minutes) a mosaic-like quality, but what can I say...it works. For what it sets out to do, pretty much EVERYTHING about this game works. Is it 'challenging'? No. It's not meant to be. Is it 'long'? Well, from what I can tell thus far, it may indeed have quite a bit of replayability as there's a sufficiently large landscape to explore, and quite a number of achievements to unlock, but quite how many hours of value you'll get for your whopping great eight-dollar investment I can't yet rightly say.     As long as you have some idea what you're buying, you shouldn't have much to complain about. It's a 'walking simulator'...NOT CALL OF ♥♥♥♥ING DUTY. If you want to shoot guns and snipe enemies from afar, you've come to the wrong place. If you're happy to wander around a surreal, serene landscape for ten minutes then witness the end of the world, you just might get a little more out of it. It's NICE, okay? (In a, er, semi-nihilistic, apocalyptic kinda way.) Between this and the recent Australian film These Final Hours, I can safely say that I now feel perfectly at peace with the notion of Armageddon.    You know what this is? It's a thing of extraordinary beauty. Simple as that. A work of art. Think of it as an excellent 'tech demo' with a strong aesthetic and a THEME. Something which most of the more fully-fledged 'games' out there tend to lack in, in other words. Definitely not one for the 'speed runners', but the more open-minded and open-hearted among us might even find ourselves MOVED, dare I say, even if only for ten minutes or so.    Verdict: 9/10.",1,0

Cons - The worst culprit by far is the female narrator. She drove me nuts! She narrates what is happening to her like she is reading the weather and it's going to be sunny all day. Not convincing at all and I couldn't even click through the narrative to shut her up (she really needs shutting up). - The HOS seemed too cluttered (yeah, I know they're supposed to be) to the point where I struggled sometimes to distinguish one shape from another. - The time travel tool gives you a ! which indicates an area you can explore/solve a clue next, but I got to the stage where there were no ! anywhere and for the life of me, I couldn't find the last item I needed to progress. I even consulted a Bigfish guide but gave up when I couldn't find a solution.  Sorry, Artifex Mundi. I love and have played most of your other games but this one is not your best.   Hala xxx  P.S.

Introducing perk points is another downfall of the game if they had left it as a set number of characters that cannot be improved that would be fine, but by introducing perk points that improve the character the higher your level, it takes skill out of the game and makes it overall a worse experience especially for new players, as your fresh out the box 'petty' character could end up facing a 'legend' character. Great matchmaking.  ",-1,0

312300,Heroes Rise: HeroFall,In my opinion this game is the best in the series as everything from the previous games came together really nicely in this thrilling conclusion. I replayed the series so many times mostly because of getting all the achievements and I felt it was worth it every time. Funny enough the hardest achievement to get for me was the one where you actually die which is kind of hilarious because the game chided me for it and made it out to be the worst thing I could have ever done.   It was neat getting to see how all the different romances worked out and how I was rewarded or punished for previous choices I had made in the game. I got to see ho each of my characters changed in some of their stats as the game went or or stayed true to themselves and in the end each one is a very different hero from the last that I played.,1,0

310950,Street Fighter V,"It is not perfect, but I'm loving it. They did release it before it was 100% and could have avoided the backlash if they put more emphasis on that fact that they released it for the tournament. Right now it is definitely more competitive/multiplayer focused. The real single player will be out in a couple months. The only real complaint I have is that the Arcade Mode is missing, but capcom is working on it.   It is so clean and crisp. They had some launch problems with the online, but majority of games do have problems at launch. This game needs a fair chance. Do research on what you are buying. I knew what I was getting into buying early on. I payed $45 for SFV and I'm completely satisfied. The slow release of content over the next couple months will just make the game even better.   If you want single player and aren't in for the multiplayer just wait a few months. If you love being competitive then definitely purchase now. Street Fighter has been one of my favorite game series since birth and this entry did not disappoint me. I actually like it more than SFIV.   Capcom said this is an evolving platform. They will continue to improve and add things to the game. Voice your concerns with Capcom on the Capcom Forums if you want the game to improve.",1,0

314280,The Forgotten Ones,At first it look like a cool horror game made using the half life 2 engine the story was intresting the enviorment and surroundings was really cool but the bad things about the game takes all that and destorys it. The worst thing is the combat my god the combat it's stiff and just dosent work and all the guns do no damage making it really unfair and hard and almost unplayable the next bad thing is the pacing it's really slow and fells like nothing happens the intro to the game is to long and the starting place was horrible i was stuck for 30 min cause i could not find the key to get out the aparment next time i restared the game i found the keyes the game forgot to spawn them oh well can happen to any game also the voice acting is horrible the main character is supose to be russian but its clearly an american puting on a bad accent lot's people complained aboout the pewdiepie easter egg so they had to take that away i did not mind tho i thought it was funny. I don't wanna hate on this game cause it is a cool game and concept the combat pacing and voice acting just ruins it i know it's free and im asking alot but still if you're planing on downloding the game don't no mater if it is free i would wait for it to get updated if it ever gets updated that is. It could be a good game i mean the part in the beginning when you go in to the house and something flys past you're screen and makes a noise and all you have is a pistol so you're scared to go foward cause you saw that something bad went past it needs some serious work on the combat and some faster pacing and some objectivs that tell you what you need to do and where you need to go that would help alot since it's a free game i can put up with the voice acting if it gets some loveing it could be good game but as it stands no stay away. ,-1,0

269210,Hero Siege,"Meh. I'm surprised by the 'very positive' reviews.  You grind and grind the same area box over and over until you get the right class level, and get the right items on this life to beat the boss then move on to the next stage. You can't shoot diagonally, while the enemies can. The power selection for each class is pretty limited. (edit added: However the variety of classes, all with different skillsets, is pretty good and have nice flavor. This is one of the highlights of the game.) Wait until a sale and the game with all DLC is a couple bucks. It's underwhelming but not 'bad'. Mediocre. (edit added: Fun for a few minutes every now and then. Something I might play in between other games when I'm burned out on my other arcade-style/rogue-like games. This review is based on playing single splayer only. I cannot speak about aspects of multiplayer.)  Plus the devs and moderators on the forum are the type to delete posts and love controlling others.

367600,,I am very on the fence about this game to the point I had trouble deciding to up or down vote. I love x-com/banner saga fighting style. This game took a chance to try to differentiate itself by giving you 2 turns that you can use for any character. They did this obviously to try to be different. People have been comparing it more to chess than X-com. The problem is this is not chess and it doesn't make sense to move 1 guy 8 times in a row while your other guys sit there. I tried it and have to say I don't like the move this piece at the expense of that piece style. I bought the game and so will continue to try to put some more time in but this is a core piece of the functionality of the game. Turn based strategy games are 90% the fights and this really hamstrings it for me. I'll update if that feeling changes but for now this game is just a decent try by an indy that will be forgettable which is a shame because the setting and turnbased system is something that had me really excited.,-1,1

Not that the soundtrack isn't great, but you'll see what I mean. You will see.  ",1,0
271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Ive owned this game on two platforms. Recently i bought it again. This time during the summer sale.   First thing ill say is the multiplayer is rather grindy. Too have a really awesome car it will take a good 1-2 weeks or so (depending on if you wanna spend atleast 2+ whole days grinding missions and what car you are saving up for) for people with limited time to play. Although, you dont need these really fancy cars, helicopters, planes and now luxury yachts. A basic car, few weapons, abit of armour and friends can really bring out the best of what this game has to offer.  MONEY MAKING TIP: This wont make you money upfront but it can be worth it. Buy a CEO building maze bank being the cheapest (1mil). If playing solo grind these two missions in the 'CEO Work section'. Headhunter and sightseer. These missions are fairly easy. Especially if you have an Armoured Karuma or helicopter.  As a side note i really like how theyve made there servers. Having public lobby's, private lobby's (so on.) Theres nothing better than being in a public lobby and watching a truck being chased down by two turreted-limos! (and maybe a jet)  As for singleplayer, i think theyve done a good job developing the characters and then fitting their personalities into the game. The missions are fun, dont follow a predictable path and can be quite challenging at times. The story line can be short.   I would also like to point out that all the updates have been free. Stunt races free, heists free, all the updates and DLC has been free. No paid ones whatsoever.   NOTE:  Most of the reviews ive seen have been complaining about bans, or to be more detailed, false banning. If you encounter this issue (which i personally havent) I would suggest contacting Rockstar's support teams and resolving your issue. If you have been banned, its rather accidental (and therefore can be resolved). Or for a reason.",1,0

284460,DeadCore,"I just 100%'d the game (steam achievements) so I'm going to try and write a review. Yay!  DeadCore is a fantastic FPS parkour puzzle speedrunner game. The objective is to reach the top of a mysterious tower by running, jumping, and using your trusty Switch Gun to activate and/or deactivate switches, enemies, moving walls, and gravity fields, while trying not to get disintegrated by lasers or fall to your death (which is by lasers most of the time anyway because a floor of lasers follows you upwards whenever you reach a new checkpoint). Most of the enemies don't actually kill you, but the turrets and troopers launch you away (often into lasers) and the mosquitoes slow you down (so you can be killed by moving lasers).  The whole game can be speedrun in less than an hour, but it takes several hours to finish the first time, familiarise yourself with the levels, learn some speedrun strats, and find the hidden Sparks to unlock the game's true ending.  + The controls are simple and responsive: WASD to move, E to boost, M1 to shoot, M2 to aim (personally didn't find much point in aiming), and M3 to blast. + The feeling of speed is very nicely communicated (did I describe that right?) + The graphics are very nice and sleek-looking, even on very low (;_; my computer) + The levels are well designed, with some tough challenges, often with multiple paths, and encourage a bit of exploration to find the collectables + Speedrun mode! Leaderboards! Beat the devs! + Beating the dev times, completing a paticularly difficult section of a level, finding short cuts, finding hidden collectables, and just being launched high into the air and boosting around, gives a lot of satisfaction. +/- The difficulty ramps up quite a bit, and in the later levels you will die many times to the challenges. This is a personal thing, I enjoyed the difficulty but some people won't. - Story doesn't really make sense. Or maybe I'm too literal-minded. - You have no body and it's a bit hard to know what your hitbox is going to do  Overall a great game, I highly recommend it to fans of first person parkour or speedrun games, and people who like a challenge.",1,1

No.  The biggest issue with the game is its censorship. its not hard to bypass, but its there, which is a huge negative in my opinion.  Then theres the translation issues. If you dont get the patch (which youre an idiot if you dont), unless you can speak and understand fluent japanese, there will be a huge portion of the game that is nigh undecipherable. Spelling, grammar, incorrect sentence structure, its as if the translation team literally spent 0 hours trying to translate this properly, and instead sent it through google translate.  My biggest personal qualm would have to be the still images. There is probably only 3 variations of each location. Of which there are about 10. Thats 30 images total. Put together with the different expressions and poses the characters are actually in, makes it seem as if they arent moving, they are simply being copy and pasted into a different place. Its very immersion breaking and kinda hilarious. Not in a good way. This is all just personal qualms, but they are prevelent through out the entire 'game' (its not a game... there are like 5 decisions, which are totally stupid and seem utterly pointless)  The final issue i have with this game is the characters. Do i even need to say anything about Aoi? He is the luckiest son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ on earth, having nearly 20 beautiful women all near him. At an age where his hormones should have been RAGING (Hes 14-15, give or take a year or so). Sure hes awkward, but so much so he is utterly clueless for most of the novel. In fact, its almost like He was written to be a bland narrator instead of an actual changing person. I dont think i saw him one time in the entire novel say anything that wasnt unexpected or surprising. Not even when he was talking about his 'injury' (he scrapped his knee. boohoo. hes a little ♥♥♥♥♥). Hell, even (WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS) when they learned what happened to isuka he acted like a emotionless robot narrator.  There are alot of Visual Novels that have been released first in japanese then translated into english for a steam release. You really want a fantastic Visual Novel experience? Get Clannad, or Katawa shoujo, or the numerous others that are a higher quality when it comes to story, length, and characters Do not waste your money on this.",-1,0

I personally think that it is a fantastic game, but only on the gameplay. The story however, the most important element to all MGS games, is not that good. Story is sparse, and offers no closure on this series like it was promised to do. This, is why MGSV is LITERALLY a Phantom Pain. This aside, I do reccomend it.

Great game with some small issues, but i look passed them overall. recommended for people who are loot junkies and love a good crafting system. the real fun in this game comes from building your gear and ranking it up. as you can see, i like Warframe, and i actually plan on spending money on it, which most F2P games don't get me to do, but i'm enjoying it a lot more than i thought i would..",1,0

40400,AI War: Fleet Command,"This is one of the best games of the last years.  AI War: Fleet Command is a strategy game which you will love. Building your econemy, your ships (lots of ships; if you say, I'll attack with 400 ships, there are really 500 ships on the map...and you need them), creating your tactics and win against the AI...or lose. Sounds normal? This game has some more stuff than other games...or better, it is doing everything a bit different. It is relativ hard to get into the game. But after one, two, three houres of playing you get it (hotkeys, fight mechanics, etc. ). And than it gets really good.  The 'story' behind this fighting is, that AI populations have taken the world we know (or better the universe) and the human species has to recover and fight back. Every solarsystem is to capture, because the AI got everything, so you have to fight from the beginning. 'War is not fair' are the introducing words of that game. And that's true. The AI got reinforcement out of nowhere, but that's not a minus for the game, because that's how it works. You get better, the AI too, so get some friends and play it coop, it is much more fun to tell someone how unfair it is, that the AI is sending again 600 bombers to you homeworld ;) and it is impossible to beat the AI alone on higher difficulties.  For these who don't like micro-strategy, just take everything you have and click on the enemy. They have so many livepoints, that you have to concentrate you fire always on one ship of thair ships, so it's not that important which ship is where, just that it is in combat :). Or you have the option to play as a champion. Than you have no base, just one big ship which gain lvl and better weapons over time, so you have to care about nothing than your 'hero' (a little RPG in strategy).  But the other are right, be warned: This game is huge. You play normaly over 7 houres on one campain. If you play with friends on bigger maps, it can take over 20h, so be sure to have enougth time.  And...If you like soundtracks, buy it! Don't think about the game...this Music is epic, you can listen to it for hours and there are so beautiful songs between (AncientShadows, Cries of Zenith are my favorites ;) ) ...amazing...(with the expensions there are over 5.5h music)  So if you like space strategy games or really good musik buy that game...and on sale day like now (the holiday sale) it is nearly for free. (I would recommend to buy the expensions too (the collection))",1,0

358750,Sunrider: Liberation Day - Captain's Edition,"When this game first launched it was an ok linear visual novel/strategy game. It had some improvement over the first game, but also some steps backwards. With the content added in the 'Captains Edition', this game evolved into something great. You still must play though the original meidocre campaign to unlock (and make sense of) the second campaign, which is where things take a turn for greatness. Part of the reason why it is so great, is due to the first campaign being not so great. The masterful way that they fixed the game, was by taking the short comings of the first campaign and turing it into the strength of the second campaign. The pay off of it is incredibly satisfying.  Obviously this is all IMO, but if they had just made the game that people thought they wanted in the first place (myself included), it wouldn't even be as good as what the game is now.",1,0

225080,Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons,"Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons ties its gameplay, or perhaps more accurately, the controlling mechanics to its narrative well. This is its strongest element. Each hand controls a brother, which seems simple enough on paper, but it can take a little while to become familiar with them.  This is where things start to progress downhill, in my opinion. The game is very much story-driven, only taking about 3 hours to complete. The beautiful and sometimes grim European fantasy landscapes seemed to change too often, too fast, and did not ask much of me to progress. Puzzle difficulty increased marginally from beginning to end.  The simple story is filled with conveniences in its plot, and also lacks in depth. Its unfavorable portrayal of female characters throughout struck me as odd. The wonderful score can only distract from these faults for so long. There are a couple very strong moments within the game, however I would not recommend this title on those merits alone.   Edited for tone. ",-1,0

236870,HITMAN™,"BEWARE! ALWAYS ONLINE DRM!  The first three levels (2 tutorials + first real level) are really well done and so far I 'was' having fun. The game's DRM though prevented me from enjoying the rest of my evening, as apparently the game servers went down and game told me I am unable to load the saved game I made 2 minutes before, because I lost connection to the almighty game server. Stupid me, welcome to 2016 when the game tells you it is late and it's time to stop playing.  Thanks to that hidden feature, at least I have time to write this review. So let's start with three major points:  1. The game is a technical disaster. Two 770GTX GPUs in SLI here - game settings fixed texture quality to Low with no way to change and also fixed maximum resolution to 1080p with options above, greyed out. (found out there is a way to set higher resolution via launch options and it works great, but apparently the devs didn't want to risk someone having a slight dip in FPS) 2. Game divided into episodes. Seriously, this game is supposed to release a new level every month. The game developer/publisher wants me to play one level for a whole 30 days before they decide to give me the next slice of the pie I already paid for. That is of course if it lets you play, which gets me to the next point... 3. ALWAYS F-IN ONLINE DRM! This is absolutely amazing, but apparently if you play with your internet connetion on, the game creates save games that are online-only! The game comes with a parental lock already implemented and it doesn't matter how old you are. When the game servers want to sleep, so should you! Stop complaining and welcome to 2016 world of DRMs. Truly unbelievable.  Honestly I would say to wait for a patch, but the issues I described are design flaws and they won't be fixed. It is a pity as I loved every other previous Hitman game. This one also is very very good, but there is no way to play it... it is either missing levels or missing ability to load save games.  That said I could at least enjoy the rest of the beer I'm drinking, while writing this (instead of playing the game) and I hope someone will hesitate to buy after reading this.

375220,Bitweb,"Bitweb is a top-down action puzzle game where you control the walls around to to avoid enemies and collect items for points. It unfortunately suffers from several problems:   - There's no tutorial, help text, or manual. The effects of the items could use some explaining. (For example, did you know that you can throw the blue stick things using the spacebar? I certainly didn't!)  - The core gameplay mechanic, 'xor-ing', is unintuitive and difficult to figure out. Nothing in the game indicates what clicking on the screen does exactly. The walls change sometimes, but sometimes they change even when you don't click. Eventually, I figured out that where you click on the screen matters, as well as whether you use the right or left mouse button, but I still have no idea what to do to progress beyond randomly mashing on the mouse.  - In general, the game feels unpolished. There's no menu screen or GUI except for the score and high score. Hitting Escape immediately closes the game window, and it doesn't even bother to save the high score.  All in all, Bitweb is a good start to a game, but not something I'd recommend playing in its current state.",-1,0

322170,Geometry Dash,"Geometry Dash is by far one of the greatest and most addicting platforming games I have ever played, and I applaud RobTop, who has made a masterpiece with this game, available on Steam and mobile devices.  The game's concept is simple in nature: you control a cube, and you must jump over and duck under obstacles such as spikes and buzz saws in the correct order to complete levels.   However, from there, things get more complicated: the cube can turn into a spaceship, a UFO, a gravity ball, a wave, and a robot, through use of special portals, and all of those transformations act differently. The speed of the stage, size of the cube, and location of the cube can change through use of other portals, and the cube can even split into two separate characters that must be controlled simultaneously. Most stages will have at least 4 or 5 of these modifiers, and they can either make a stage much easier or much more difficult.  There are 20 official levels in the game as of Update 2.0, and they range from very easy to almost impossibly difficult. Levels are rated by difficulty, including Auto, Easy, Normal, Hard, Harder, Insane, or Demon. Every level has its own unique techno-electronic soundtrack, composed by musicians who upload their content to Newgrounds.  I myself have completed all 20 of these official levels. It was extremely hard, but I did it.  Upon completing one of these levels, you are awarded stars, as well as secret coins if you managed to find them during the level. Collecting stars and coins allows you to unlock other costumes and colors for your little cube so that you can change its in-game appearance.  There are also thousands and thousands of user-created levels made with the in-game level editor that you can play to earn stars and user coins. There’s plenty of fun to have beating as many levels as you can and earning hundreds of stars, or making your own level for others to play.  In conclusion, I cannot recommend Geometry Dash enough. It is an addicting, fun platform game that will push your platforming skills to the limit and provide hours of entertainment, and everyone should at least give it a try =)",1,0

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"Batman: Arkham Knight is a dense and enthralling action-adventure game with a winding, if predictable, story that does make you feel like the Batman both inside and outside the Batmobile. There are too many Batmobile gameplay segments, however, making this predominantly similar in theme to that Batmobile-focused Batman arcade game. This is unfortunate, as the presence of the Batmobile ensured a much larger, multi-layered Gotham City that looks wonderful and was crafted with an unnecessary level of detail. The combat and stealth are the same as before, but their adjustments and brevity keep the familiar Batman sections just different enough to feel new. As intended, the Batmobile is a nice change of pace, even if its numerous sections get old and nearly overstay their welcome. From start to finish, there is constantly something interesting to take in and someone interesting to take down, making Batman: Arkham Knight in the end a game worth playing.",1,0

The maps are crowded and boring with half as much resources as play than in the previous Civ. The tech tree, while being new and experimental, is confusing and messy. It just doesnt feel right and you have to mod it just to make it easier to follow. The rivaling civs are boring, it's easy to lose track of who is who because every civ is some boring no-name with some generic corporate acronym they are representing. I see that Firaxis is trying to do something 'realistic'...but it just comes off boring. Also there just isn't much to do in this game...until the expected expansions.  This is a problem with games nowadays, shipping incomplete games devoid of polish or satisfying content. The Sims and Civ are the biggest offenders here.

It turns repetitive at times, but it is a platformer (remember Contra?) so it is not that bad. Then, it is sadly kinda short (however, that prevents it from getting boring).  I would not have given it 10/10 if it wasn't for its best feature.... an incredibly funny co-op mode!!! I was laughing like mad along with my wife while completing the co-op levels together.

This game however can be much more enjoyed if you play the first game, altough it has allot of flaws it definiatly pays off when you play this game. You can still play this game without playing the one before with maybe a little of reading into the first story.

1930,Two Worlds: Epic Edition,"By far one of the most memorable and underrated RPGs ive ever played. This game recieved mostly all negative reviews on release and was hated by most critics. I didn't know any of this before I saw in an EB Games and picked it up for a cheap price on disk.   Two Worlds is definitely a flawed game. The writing is ♥♥♥♥, with everyone speaking in the old style english language that sounds ridiculous and out of place. On top of the writing is the atrocious voice acting (which is funny). The starting game cutscene even features writing where a character repeats a Monty Pyton quote word for word which is farcical. The devs also decided to use laughable names for certain things in the game, for example calling some sort of plague 'The Taint'. Two Worlds was also riddled with bugs on release (patched with expansions in Epic Edition) which didn't help at all in the way of reviews. Looking past those issues though, Two Worlds is an enjoyable experience. Reviews on Youtube do great in making this game look like a laughfest of asinine writing and technical flaws, but besides those issues, the game at its core is an ambitious underachiever which still succeeds in providing to the player for the most part.   The main menu music was the first thing that stood out when I started the game, which complimented the pretty wonderful soundtrack. Two Worlds takes place in Antaloor, a mysterious and expansive setting that always kept me expecting more. I never felt like I was playing a walking simulator (even though the world is huge), nor did I feel like I was being attacked left and right. The game did nicely in striking a balance between a good amount of action and passive adventuring. Two Worlds also includes a multiplayer component, with PvP and Co-op. I never really played it though because the population was mostly Eastern European, so English was pretty rare. The combination of the two leaves a lot for the player to do. Questing, exploring, looting, messing around, and kicking ♥♥♥ is always an option. The cities are big and populated, and felt very lively. I personally was in love with the variety of awesome armor and weapons, which is what I liked the most.You can also choose how you want to play, throughout the entirety of the game. There are no preset classes or anything, so you can play however you want to. You can play melee the whole game, or be a hybrid archer mage warrior. How you choose to fight is only limited by what you have in your inventory and your skill levels. The combat system is also one of the few ive experienced that actually works. The targeting system is automated which can be troublesome but rarely is it actually. You can't always button mash to win though, since you can easily die, but its satisfying and rewarding. The combat is nothing innovative nowadays, but it works and its fun. I always looked forward to what kind of loot I would find. I would be ecstatic when I would find a new piece of armor that made my character look lawesome. The graphics for it's time were decent at best. Far distance rendered poorly and the textures and effects were pretty basic but taking into account how expansive the world is, with all the different types of environments, it was justified. The armors and weapons did have pretty intricate details though. Even if you had to game maxed out and ran at 60fps plus, it still looked choppy thanks to the animations. Hours can easily be lost in this game when you realize all that there is to do in the game world. If you really choose to, you can hate this game. Two Worlds has quirky dialogs, a poor storyline, weird people, terrible voice acting, questionable sound choices (attacking someone with a sword plays punching sounds?) and ugly animations. To me, these issues were relatively unimportant, which is why I enjoyed the game as much as I did. Two Worlds always had something that allowed me to forgive it for its issues.  So much in this game can be done in the way of customization and how you want to play. I still consider myself pretty lucky to have given this game a chance and I still remember experiences from 5+ years ago. To add, I can safely say I enjoyed this game just as much as any Elder Scrolls game, which seem to be the standard which any RPG is based on nowadays. Two Worlds lacks polish and is nowhere near perfect, but underneath all of the minor issues, is a gem. A gem of a game that is immensely underrated and misunderstood. Despite all you may read, this game is an immersive and rich experience that can leave you glued to your screen for hours. It's up to you to realize that not every game needs to be technically perfect, its how you appreciate it and your ability to see through the rough edges.",1,0

372000,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),"  Before you begin reading note that most people here tested the game before it was even avaible for public, currently it's f2p and most bugs and issues have been fixed and no lag seems to affect the servers anymore, so forget about that, it's all good now, botters are also gone, Ave maria.  Cons: 1. The way I see it what matters is the experience itself and not the game's features, if you're looking for a good time with your friends, this might not be as fun as Ragnarok, and by that I mean, you don't get to stick to your friends, the questline will push you further and further into more missions rather than make you grind mobs in a group, eventually you will find yourself teleporting from map to map to complete your missions and so on, so forget about team work unless you're running a guild which is incredibly expensive or dungeons that you only get to do past level 50 twice a day.  2. If you like to play by the market and go full merchant shekelstein, go ahead, but not without premium, so forget your profit because you won't get any with a 30% tax and no currency trading or whatsoever, you can only trade items and with premium you get a 10% taxation on the market, which is still a great rip off in your profits, IMC crippled us good here.  3. Another problem you might find is leveling up, not that it's hard but you'll have a hard time figuring out when to use your exp cards and knowing what maps you should clear first, also, you must clear all maps and do all quests otherwise you stagnate late game and get stuck with no cards and no missions, you mustn't do them too late nor too early, otherwise you'll have hard time grinding less than 1% exp mobs, worst case scenario your equipment gets trashed and you are left broke with no money and no conditions to come back.  4. Unfortunately, aesthethical customization is an issue, you don't have many options besides your hair which you don't even get to choose the color, you'll have to grind mobs to get different colors, and hats are mostly either expensive and hard/impossible to get or they're so common everyone has them, very limited in my opinion, a waste for such a well detailed game. No visual diversity at all.  Pros: 1. Great characters, great animations and the music is simply amazing, it won't make your head ache and it synchronizes damn well with the map themes, the graphics are awesome and certainly drew most of the game base by it's aesthethic sense 10/10 for drawing efforts.  2. After the updates there is no lag and mostly no bugs, not sure if they fixed all classes but it's all good as far as I've gone through, the players in the brazilian server are quite friendly and will help you out, and most certainly will need your help in return sooner or later, goldsellers are unable to profit due to no silver trade and steam currency packs are now selected by server and will probably have different prices, so no more exploiting, no need to ♥♥♥♥ everyone equally like before, IMC disposes of a bad decision making team shame on them, but it's fixed for now, I hope.  3. The game simply offers you many features and builds, you'll find yourself immersed in your class, be it a full highlander glasscannon or a supporting hybrid tank heretic gypsie druid, althought some classes are useless as far as I'm concerned, you can ♥♥♥♥ up your character easily so don't go around doing stupid ♥♥♥♥ pretending to know what you're doing.  4. Just go and see for yourself, it's grindy but fun, everything about it is well done and the gameplay feels really great, the PvP is pretty fun too, the game is one of a kind, go check it out!",1,1

202530,SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 4 Episode I,"I'll be honest: the first time i played this game, i hated it because the physics are terrible when compared with the original Sonic games. I don't know how anyone could screw this up. After a while, i got used to it, but this game really doesn't play like the originals. They aren't that bad, it's just that they were way better in the originals. Putting that aside, the game is filled with nostalgia, with recycling stages, enemies and bosses, but changed somewhat. The special stages are based on the original Sonic, and you can unlock Super Sonic which plays much better that the standard one. There's 4 stages with 3 acts and a boss each, plus a final boss. There's also leaderboards (the score attack is kinda useless) and achievements. The graphics are just okay and the music passable. To sum it up, if you can overlook the physics, this is a decent Sonic game, just not one of the good ones.",1,0
8190,Just Cause 2,"Just Cause 2 is an open world blow'm-up simulator in the same vein as a Grand Theft Auto or Saint's Row; half the fun is messing with the physics of the world.  The major success of Just Cause is that it gives players the tools to explore the world to its fullest extent. Your character's grappling hook is the most obvious of these, giving you the ability to traverse terrain at high speed, rope in enemies, or tie objects together. With a little imagination, it's the best thing since the Gravity Gun of Half Life 2... and both can be used to overturn vehicles!  Furthermore, the protagonist is rather agile in his ability to manoever. While his ability to safely hop on top of a moving, swerving car makes little sense, it also makes him able to do fun things... like throwing delicious explosives at pursuers. He can ride anything, grab on to anything, and jump anywhere, and it results in a very liberating experience once you get the hang of 'the rules' of these manoevering abilities.  As a car-jacking game, there are a TON of vehicles, and excuses to use them. Even when you acquire air travel and fast travel, there are many reasons why you'd use land vehicles; either they're more practical for quick getaways, have weapons attached, or you just want to ride on an occupied vehicle to keep your hands free to blow things up.  There are only two minor downsides to this game. First, the story; it takes itself a bit too seriously for a game where you can tie someone to a jet as its taking off, and it doesn't relax its tone until the end. Second, this game lacks the ability for multiplayer - yes, there is an awesome multiplayer mod, but it's pure free-roam and without NPCs; the game proper does not support multiplayer when it feels like it should (having one player driving, another car-surfing, and another para-gliding would be an awesome way to make a getaway).  However, these flaws are minor; the gameplay is satisfying, the world is gorgeous, and the price is right. Heck, the price may even be too low; Steam Sales have pitched this game as low as $2 when it is easily worth much more. Unless you really don't like gunplay and violence, this game is an absolute blast and recommended for anyone looking for some creative destruction.",1,0

I thought you would be playing the hero that ends up saving the day, but in the end it apears that i was the villian the whole time.

Campaign map crashes probably once per hour. Diplomacy is utterly pointless even single territory countries with like 2 units will refuse peace treaties by a 100 territory super power with 80units surrounding thier last city.

Short campaign at around 3 hours and DLC around 1 hour, but both are worth it for experience in my opinion. Especially with the collectables in the game revealing a mini documentary about certain aspects of the game and history of the Alaskan’s and how they live which I found compelling.  Also If you are an achievement hunter, this game is easy to 100%. Overall I enjoyed the experience of this game with the nice graphics and atmospheric sound and visuals. One negative, towards the enjoy the game the puzzling becomes sometimes unclear or harder than it should when it won’t connect with a ledge for example, that was frustrating  ",1,0

This game reminds me a whole lot of Black Ops 3 (GUI and Gameplay Wise) The game feels kinda like it has a stick on every character that doesnt bend just is forced to move awkwardly I feel all the guns have a very odd recoil pattern. Apparently this game is related to some Anime Show, I'm not sure. Game is alright only reasy I didnt suggest it is because its free. So try it yourself see if you like it. No harm no foul.

It would take a year to figure out on your own all the secrets. The game is easily completable without doing any puzzles. But this is a game that takes extreme thought to complete and to enjoy. To play this game you must immerse yourself into a magical and complicated world and cannot just simply walk away from weird heryoglyphs or star patterns and owls that give you riddles without thinking about the deeper meaning behind it. This game are for those who can play a masterpiece without going to a wiki, because otherwise the game is utterly useless and a waste of your time. Phil Fish said to play the game like the internet never existed and do to that you certainly must. I highly reccomend this game to those who can think outside the box... and outside of the outside. And also to those who are multi dimentionaly gifted. Get this game to experience this world that has been created with such precision, and play it on your own with absolutely no outside help. It is your adventure after all. Isnt it?",1,0

227300,Euro Truck Simulator 2,"-Personal opinion of an truck enthusiast  A very amazing driving-simulator game. 7 different truck brands (some brands can offer you more truck models), enable you to relax and drive across the central part of Europe. With map-expansions, the world map gets even bigger. At the moment, Scandinavia and Eastern Europe map expansion is available for you. Of course, there are several other DLCs, such as paintjobs and trailer packs.   I play this kind of simulation for 5 years now. I am sure, games made from SCS software can never disappoint you, but everyone gets tired of games, especially if they are ''only'' singleplayer. In this case, the official Euro truck simulator 2 Multiplayer  http://truckersmp.com/en_US  can help you. Good community, fair staff and lots of truck enthusiast play here every day. Lots of different servers available!   So, in my general opinion this game deserves more than one cookie...Some pros and cons:  Pros: -Very big map, so the game can't be completed in 1 month at all, if you play normally -7 truck brands, all of them got original names -Truck tuning for those who want to get their truck ''famous'' on the roads -Realistic envirionment, AI traffic (sometimes just n00b), trailers and companies -Some jobs take more than 2 hours :)  Cons: After a long time of playing, you realise that the map is too small...

Yet, it lacks substance, though. It blows my mind that the demo with the two bathing girls and their stereo, which was shown a long time ago, was a good percentage of the game.   Firewatch felt a bit like Gone Home: the same amount of substance, but put into a much larger room.  I think if we could craft our own stories in the world, through mod-tools, this game might actually have some legs. But the world is too small even to consider that a possibility.  Really big bummer. I had some fun and I enjoyed all the sights, but I'm very disapppointed that this game was only ankle-deep. It's unfortunate even I (who loved Gone Home) can't recommend picking this game up at any more than $10.",-1,0

218230,PlanetSide 2,"This is about the only multiplayer game I play these days. As an MMO, you can level up your abilities and fight in large-scale battles. As an FPS, you can drop in an out at will without causing certain death of your comrades. The game supports a huge variety of play styles, with multiple player classes and the ability to both pilot and co-pilot both land and air vehicles (I've always loved the idea of being a gunner on a vehicle that someone else is driving, and this game does a good job of implementing that).  Of course the main downside is that as a free-to-play game it waves microtransaction opportunities around in your face. Fortunately most of them are cosmetic, so it's not straight-up pay-to-win. Even given the fact that many people will outlevel you even just through regular grinding, there is still plenty of opportunity for any player to get kills via skill and/or luck, to help with strategic objectives such as capturing points, and to provide team support in the form of repairs, ammo, healing/reviving, etc.  Another negative aspect of the game is that when playing via a casual drop-in/drop-out style, it can be hard to find a group that isn't just screwing around. The game makes it easy to join groups of players, but it seems like at least 3/4 of the time there's no point because everyone is scattered all over the place and nobody is in charge.",1,0
3800,Advent Rising,"Take part Mass Effect, part Halo, and throw in a dash of Star Wars and you get Advent Rising. This is the utmost praise, however, as Advent Rising is a fantastic game. It is clear that Mass Effect borrowed heavily from this game as the Geth seem to be ripped straight from it. The fiction behind the story is some of the most engrossing sci-fi I've seen in a while, which is no surprise since it was written by Orson Scott Card.  The gameplay is third-person, with the use of guns and special powers. The guns do feel really nice, but I found myself using the powers more often, especially in the later game. The level design is superb as well, and I never felt lost, even in some of the bigger environments.  The game is not without it's faults, however. Consulting   PC Gaming Wiki   [pcgamingwiki.com]  is a must for essential fixes, but I still had a fair number of issues. There were graphic anomalies when things got intense and there were lots of explosions. cutscenes would sometimes hicup as well, although the dialogue did not skip. The most annoying thing were the game crashes which happened a handful of times. Thankfully, the game saved at the exact point of the crash so nothing was lost, but still annoying.  Iffy port aside, this game is fantastic. It really is a shame we will probably never see the planned sequels as this game builds a very promising lore and world around it. It's certainly worth playing, just know that it will probably never get a proper finale. ",1,1

You'll find the same things in this game, that have drawn you to other games in the series. Lots of free running, lots of sneaking around, and lots of side quests; additionally, they brought back the idea of giving you an objective, and letting you accomplish it how you see fit, be that via brute force, stealth, or by taking advantage of numerous distraction opportunities. I'm not sure how anyone else has reacted, but the co-op is quite a bit of fun as well...It's something that this game series should have had a long time ago, in my opinion. The graphics are also pretty fantastic in this new installment.  Take this for what it's worth. I'm enjoying the game, but am disappointed with it's less than stellar release, however I am contented waiting for further updates. If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, I recommend passing on this one, and maybe grabbing on sale in several months when more issues have been worked out. I'll be honest, Ubisoft kind of pisses me off, but I'm glad they have been sticking with it so far, and continue to release update patches.

With that said MtG 2015 is an insult to any magic fan and any online magic gamer. The game offers you the ability to create decks. Which is sweet, albeit with 100% unlocks insanly limited selection. So that feature is really only half done at best. To impliment this feature they stripped away the absolute best feature of the game. TWO HEADED GIANT has been removed. This feature is literally the make or break on a game like this. Without TWO HEADED GIANT there is no reason for anyone to return and play after unlocking and making a few playable decks.

207170,Legend of Grimrock,"In my world, Legend Of Grimrock would be called 'The reincarnation of Eye Of The Beholder', or something of the sort, as I have really good memories of the first Eye Of The Beholder game from the early 1990s (although I never beat it), and Legend Of Grimrock looks just like it. Just recently I realized Eye Of The Beholder itself was a reincarnation (or what some people would call 'a clone' or 'a ripoff') of a similar game called 'Dungeon Master' from the 1980s (which I've never heard of until recently), but 'nuff said about that.  Back to Legend Of Grimrock -  The game is a first person dungeon crawling Action/RPG. You play a group of 4 adventurers (aka convicted criminals, but nevermind about that :P), whose goal is to survive the dungeon by means of solving puzzles and fighting monsters while staying alive in the process.   The default party consists of two fighters (one human, one minotaur), one wizard and one rogue, set in a fixed formation of two rows - two characters in front, two more behind them. You can choose which character to place where and change it while playing, but you can't change the formation. The idea is that the two front characters use melee attacks, while the other two need to attack from long range (either magic, throwing weapons such as knives, or missile weapons such as bows).  Up until now (8-10 hours ingame), I'm really having fun. Technically, everything looks and feels good. There's nothing overwhelming about the graphics or the music, but they are definitely good enough. Come to think of it, there's hardly any music ingame, and I think it's a really good idea. The lack of music makes the game feel more realistic, and it lets you pay the worthy attention to the sound effects, which just like with Eye Of The Beholder, play an important role, as they serve as warning signs from certain enemies. The controls are simple and intuitive (left click to move items, right click to attack when it comes to battles). Some of the puzzles are very easy, others are more difficult. I did find it necessary to look for help online in a couple of incidents so far, but I did manage to solve most of the puzzles myself (up to where I am at the moment, can't say anything about the puzzles I haven't reached yet).   All in all, this game is fun. If you like dungeon crawlers, get it. It might not be a masterpiece, but it is fun to play.",1,0

325610,Total War: ATTILA,"DO NOT BUY, UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO KEEP PAYING SEGA AND CA FOR CONTENT  Just a week after release, they decide to release yet another DLC. The second one, since release. You only get half the game for 40 euro, so be awere - you'll have to pay yet another 15 euros to get the rest of the content, that should be in the game at release.  That said, amazing game - Love raiding the damned British people, or turn Rome to a pile of ashes with my armies. Combat has gotten alot of fun, and seem alot more dynamic. Theres alot of micro mangement, and you always gotta keep an eye on your cavelry and flanks now - which is awesome!  The campain map is at times dull, but the diffculity of the game is awesome! I usely play at very hard or legendary, but had to play at hard, just to survive the first 50 turns. If you don't watch your back, thoose damn vikings are gonna tear your empire apart and sail away, before you can even turn your armies around!  I would have rated this game with a positive review, if it hadn't been for CA and Sega's buisness strategy. Forcing people to pay 40 euros for a game is fair. But it's not fair if you release 2 DLC's within a week of release, for 'Just another 15 euro'. I would gladly have payed 55 euros for this game, if i knew that i would get the entire game! But these sneaky releases are just some bull, to force every fan out there to spend more money! That is the reason why I'm not giving a positive review.",-1,0

359320,Elite Dangerous,"After seeing all the negitive reviews I decided to review it myself. Most negitive reviews circle around the fact that the NPCs were OP, with top-of-the-line Engineer upgrades. If you read the recent changes and patch notes, you will see that NPCs have been stripped of their Engineering OP-ness. So that's been taken care of :P  Gameplay can go from a very relaxed delivery, to a hectic battle in a matter of seconds. There is always something to do, even if its just exploring. It's also incredibly fulfilling to buy your own ship and customize it. Not to mention the game is beautiful, and can run on medium graphics cards well.   Pros: Relaxing gameplay (if you want it) Exciting gameplay (again, if you want it) Beautiful ship interiors Lovely fighting Massive scale Simulated trade markets VR support (God, I want a headset)  Cons: Always online DRM, even in solo play (Grrrrr) The galaxy map is cluttered, makes it hard to see the proximity of closer systems Controls need to be HEAVILY customized, the default layout sucks (unless you have 34 fingers) It doesn't NEED a joystick (i've got many hours on m&amp;k) but it really deserves it (I suggest the cyborg V.1 if you like E:D, its only $20) The launcher stays open when the game boots (I hate game that do that)",1,1

226740,Monster Loves You!,"You emerge from the womb presented with three dialog options. We’re not talking ‘red blue or green’ and we’re certainly not talking ‘attack defend or route.’ Your choices are some meandering fancy like “scoop up slime, hold your breath, or call for help.” Welcome to Monster Loves You, where dialog choices comprise the whole of the gameplay. Revel in stat bonuses for choosing the right option —it’s always the right option— and accrue new dialog choices based on your newfound stats. But watch out! Don’t get enough stats —it’s never enough— and you will unknowingly close yourself off from other dialog options.  If you think that choosing an option is actual gameplay, this is the game for you! It’s like Final Fantasy X’s combat with none of the consequences or combat. If you want to be mentally stimulated then this is not the Cart Life for you. I think this game is actually for kids. Like the literal kind of children, not the autismal man kind. Cute 4 girls but you know what? Girls want to play a video game. You know casual appeal of Bejewel and Peggel where you choose a touch and stuff goes? In Monster Loves You there is choose a touch but then you just choose more and more touch. Monster does not even love you until late-game.   Has: - Artistic Direction - Be your own monster! - Touch or mouse. It’s all good.  Lacks: - Gameplay Element (really dropped the ball on this one) - Animation - Sokoban Block Puzzle  Winblows 8 Touch Screen Bonus - You are not an iPad!  2 / 10 Boring as a generous bag of wet nails.

251060,Wargame: Red Dragon,"Even worse than AirLand battle. The AI still relies on spam and rushes. The AI still gets several times as many points as you have. The AI is omnipotent. Multi-ton tanks can drive up 90 degree slopes faster than I could climb them. Naval combat (the 'big' feautre of this game) is a blob-fest with no tactics whatsoever. Your units still have absolutly no common sense. Units move stupidly close to enemies when out of thier primary ammo (such as a helo that is out of ATGMs or an artillery piece that is out of long range shells) and promptly get killed (rather than staying put.) Radar guided AA autocannos and IR missiles are unaffected by ECM (a plane's only defense aganst AA.) Artillery firing from 20+KM is more accurate than a sniper rifle. The deck system has been entirely f---ed up. (I can only call in five cards of a unit catagory at a high price compared to ALB.) Most units are entirely useless compared to thier alternatives. This game is still micro-intensive. Mountains (and all the rocks on them) no longer block LOS. Open fields can sometimes block LOS. The AI has an 'everything' deck. Where as we would have to choose either no bonus or a bonus specific to a deck type, the AI can have an Armored, motorized, mechanized, airborne, marine, support, naval deck with all of the same bonus (and much higher unit avaliability) as you can with a specialized deck.  Its every bad thing about ALB and then some. I've only seen two improvements: AI now includes a varying unit composition with its spam (i.e. AA with its armor) There are a few hundred new units.  This game is not even worth the $10 I paid for it while it was on sale, nevermind $40 if it was not.  Edit: add naval to the list as well. REDFOR is still OP. Its even worse if you're playing against the AI. The first mission in one of the campaign basically places you in a hopeless situation.

250320,The Wolf Among Us,"7/10  The Good: Just as The Walking Dead, this game is a point and click adventure. The story is interesting, entertaining and morally ambigious. It is how the player reacts to the moral questions that decides where the story is going.   The Bad: One of the biggest shortcomings of this game is its limited interactivity. Sometimes you seemingly just listen to conversations and watch events unfold for minutes at a time, without having the chance to effect change. Worse, even when given the chance to make a choice, it is often only cosmetic. The other problem I had were the numerous quick time events, they felt simplistic, and a contrived way to create tension.  The Verdict:  The story and moral choices are what makes this game entertaining. Though the game struggles to offer meaningful interactivity in many situations, and is a tad heavy on the quick time events. I hope Tell Tale Games can look to their excellent Walking Dead Season I to improve upon that in the next season for Wolf Among Us. Don't think its worth the full price, but definitely worth a consideration when it is on sale.",1,0

The new Lara is a much more likable character though!  There are genuine shooting mechanics this time, which will please some and anger others. But the signature platforming elements remain uncompromised, as do the accompanying puzzles.   For the purists: Unlike in Hitman Absolution, the 'instinct' mode can be almost completely ignored for the whole game and there aren't any sections that are downright unplayable without using instinct.",1,0

234190,Receiver,"This game is wonderful. It's really easy to understand and even if you don't, you can always just hit ? for info.   This is a game where reloading is a little more complicated than just hitting R. You have to go through a process to make sure your gun is in working order and that you can shot the f**k out of the machines coming to kill you. They've only made 2 machines but both can kill you easily if you don't pay attention. I won't say any more but I strongly recommend this game to anyone checking this game out.

365960,rFactor 2,"I really hate to write a negative review, But at it's current price, I connot recommend this game. The graphics are not as good as they are in the video, and I have a very high-end PC. The NASCARs are not licensed, and therefore have been changed, and look like kids toys (Not a good thing) The cars are difficult to drive, and spin whenever you go near the throttle, and the crash graphics are the worst I've seen in a car game for a long time  Dont get me wrong, this game has done some things right-The car and track selection range is pretty big, and there are mods out there (Although the community is not very active) And when you do manage to get them moving, the cars handle very realistically.  Overall, If this game was a lot cheaper, it would be amazing, but I am disappointed that I paid $44 Australian for this, and it did not meet expectations. I am going to reccomend this game, because I trust that it is better than it seems at first, And will change this review if I can get some assitance.  Rating-  Physics-7/10 Range-9/10 Crash graphics-There isnt a low enough number AI-8/10 Price-2/10   EDIT: I have just discovered the workshop, and will update this review based on the content I find there.",1,1
107310,Cthulhu Saves the World ,"Thankfully this is a rather short RPG because I don't see how anyone could tolerate it much longer than that. Pretty much every dungeon is exactly the same, big sprawling maze with random encounters and the occasional chest. The hardest thing about the game is finding the next level of the dungeon, really. Mobs generally aren't too tough and it's easy to be overpowered in this game. The bosses are kind of a joke; even the final boss took practically no effort at all. The story kind of stops caring about a quarter of the way through the game and there's no sense of atmosphere at all. It's not even that f funny, either. There's some jokes but they're far too infrequent for it to really be a comedy game. The last dungeon has a big difficulty spike which is a bit unwarranted but even then, hopping into an optional dungeon and then back into the last dungeon basically destroyed all the challenge I was having. It's just... bland. I don't like RPGs in general and only got this in a bundle, and it was short enough for me to not get bored of it, at least. I wouldn't call it 'bad' for what it is, but I certainly can't say it blew me away or anything.",-1,0

Maybe I just hadn't unlocked enough of them yet, but I mean, 23 hours in and I'm still getting the same like 10 or so weapons was getting on my nerves.

212680,FTL: Faster Than Light,"I don't usually like indie games, nor am I a fan of strategy for the most part. This is an exception. It's strangely charming. The soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful--enough so to warrant me downloading it from the Humble Bundle a while back. The visuals are serviceable, and absolutely do not detract from the experience at all; in fact, it adds to the feel of the game. This game is such an exception to what I normally like: amazing visuals and a mind-blowing experience. Faster Than Light is a different breed, and it's so good it's hard to dislike.   The gameplay is actually easy to pick up. People everywhere have always said that this is a hard game. It is and that's not a lie. However, the learning curve is quick. Just do the tutorial and you'll have it down. I'm not a particularly good player either. Really, if you're worried about the difficulty--don't. It'll make you miss out on the rest of the game.  It's primarily about light RPG elements and micromanaging your crew and ship while fleeing the Rebel fleet and finding, and fighting, friends and foes along the way. As far as I can tell, each game is randomly generated. This makes for a new experience every time. Loot is an important factor, as is upgrading and maintaining your ship. It's a very simple system, but full of difficult choices. It manages not to be overwhelming but still have some depth.   Overall, this is easily one of my favorite games. I have a very busy schedule, so I have to pick up and play for a little bit at a time, but it does have the depth to play for a long time straight.",1,0

238960,Path of Exile,"Good game. A F2P action RPG with a great backstory and soundtrack. The steam transactions are for cosmetics only, so it's not a P2W in any way.  PoE has an enormous passive skill tree, so you can build your character in many different ways. For active skills you will have to drop some gems from the mobs and level them up. There are lots of items as well [LOOT! lots of LOOT!], many different weapons/equipments and their rarities, including unique kind items. You can also use orbs to customize your items.  PVP works fine. Lots of quests. Beating PoE on normal difficulty feels like a basics tutorial once you enter the other op levels, the game gets a lot harder by the Cruel and Merciless. It took me a while to slay Simi, the mo♥♥fu♥ing monkey.  {http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=286665871}  Dying repeatedly was 'fine' since i wasn't on the hardcore league (death=delete).  I haven't played Diablo3 yet (there's a lot of discussion involving these 2 games), but even though D3 graphics are probably a bit better, this game seems good as well. It's definitely worth a try.  I had a few desync problems, and it used to get worse when in party. But then i found out about this command /ccs which is a way to manually sync with the server, and some info about the desync here:  https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/710359   Their support is really good, if you ever need help in PoE issues don't hesitate to contact them.

251060,Wargame: Red Dragon,"I would give Wargame: Red Dragon 9/10, 8 for the overall playing experience, and 1 for the superb support and constant maintanence to this game provided by Eugen.  I am no stranger to the RTS franchises and I must say that Wargame: Red Dragon has one of the harder learning curves of its rank. With about 150 hours of playing, I still don't have a firm grip of the intricate parts of the gameplays and mechanics. Though Wargame: Red Dragon is an impressive game overall, it is difficult for the new players to become the part of the active community due to its time consuming learning curve.  This is the first Wargame franchise I have played and I found lack of guidance in early experience of the game. It is necessary for the new player to spend hours on solo campaign/skirmish without much guidance to try and feel the every bits of the game. Also the overwhelming amounts of information in deck building/armory panel did not help in simplifying the experience.  As for the playing experience, Wargame: Red Dragon has many immersive battlefield system such as terrain, morale, logistics, garrisons, flying altitude, stealth/reconaissance that will keep you well occupied through the match. Each engagement requires careful examination and preparational positioning and only then, will you can gain the upperhand advantage.  If Eugen gives more friendly guidance for newcomers, I know many more players will be hooked on Wargame: Red Dragon rather than 'veteran players' from previeous franchises dominating the community. As of now, in my opinion, Wargame: Red Dragon is mostly dependent on its hardcore fan base to keep it a relevant community.  Thanks for reading.",1,0

Especially since attackers can just appear randomly from anywhere. Also, there are sometimes messages that come up and break up the game. These were normal for a while, but after a few levels they started to get a bit creepy, which I didn't like. I might come back to this game later, but for now I'm going to put it away for a while and maybe come back to play it some other time.

291650,Pillars of Eternity,"  “If there were no gods, it would have been necessary to create them.”    Pillars of Eternity is an isometric role-playing game (rpg) developed by the company Obsidian Entertainment with emphasis on tactical combat.     Atmosphere &amp; presentation:    + Vast and mature fantasy world with great love for detail. + Excellent background music enriches the atmosphere.  + Additional game mechanics, like the bounty hunter missions and castle construction, create a welcome diversion to the mundane tasks of an adventurer.  + The extension White March increases level cap and delivers additional characters, equipment and side story elements. + Clean user interface and good inventory management.  + Great replay value.   o The different factions are interesting in the beginning, but their general involvement with the player is rather small.  o Satisfying execution of almost every aspect of the game, due to several patches.    Combat &amp; gameplay:    + The ability to approach a potential combat situation in multiple ways is well balanced in the game.  + Transparent combat mechanics allow the player to understand each encounter.  + Implementation of a dynamic difficulty system provides rpg newcomers, veterans and masochists with a satisfying challenge. + Impressive customization system allows for extensive weapon and armor modifications. + Broad spectrum of skills offers good character development. + Lower spells remain efficient on higher levels.   o Party size is limited to a maximum of six characters. o The player can decide to travel alongside a companion party or custom party.     Characters &amp; story:    + The main plot is complex and multi-layered.  + Well written dialogues and narrative. + Very good voice acting of all characters. + Certain quests offer several ways to complete them. + Dialogues and events can be solved by an attribute or skill check.  + Major decisions of the player are reflected in the end sequence of the game.   o While some characters are interesting and provide an authentic development, others remain immature lacking depth.  o Not all dialogues with non-player characters are synchronized.  o The protagonist cannot start a romance.   - Any character class can learn to pick locks and disarm traps, which diminishes the attractiveness of the rogue class. - The creation of a multi-class character is not possible.    Summary:    Overall, Pillars of Eternity offers high-quality content and sophisticated gameplay. The world is fantastically immersive, and represents a wonderful role-playing experience.     Amusing quotes:      “Let’s try this again: Step aside or die chocking on your own innards.”      “What kind of coward asks for his own man to be killed? The kind who will be so enraged by it, that no amount of pain will stop him from beating you so savagely, that you will carry the disfigurement into your next life.”      Trivia:    NPCs with gold name plates were designed by the backers. Interacting with them will allow you to experience each one’s unique history.

I didn't have high hopes seen as the last two games I got excited for ( FO4 and MAFIA 3 ) were let downs. I have only a couple hours put in and thats mainly exploring. The worlds are very open with a lot to see in some parts. I've noticed theres more lore added in but I could have just missed it in the last game. Theres also the added challange of civilians mixed in some areas which adds a lot of depth. The new characters are interesting and well designed. Overall its just enjoyable and I hope it doesnt wear out with more gameplay  tl;dr - Good game, hit or miss whether it will run well/at all",1,0

But one day my inventory was deleted all the suddon and I don't quite know why but I kept playing spent well over 50 bucks on items and became pretty good at the game, but then there was meet your match, And it sucked I didn't fell like it was a good game anymore. It felt like it was trying to copy a game that was thought to copy tf2 when it really didn't. And so I stopped playing the game hoping for it to change eventually then about after a month my inventory for tf2 was almost completely wiped again with no notification or reason and wasn't even given any of that money I spent on the game back. Then just about 1 hour before I wrote this I played it again it felt broken, unfinished like it was a pre alpha. Tf2 was a great game but vavle destroyed it.#MakeTF2GreatAgain",-1,0

If you don't like shooting boring robots and turrents then you'll be like me. In between this game.   I love having only so many clips and even fewer bullets. Shooting and keeping track of how many bullets i have left. Scavaging the apartment rooms, sinks, toilets, and sometimes couch cushions for ammo. I love the feel of the game that i still am not completely sure what is going on and the story is literally given in a random order each time with few details leaving me with piecing it together gaining constant Ah Hah moments when i've achieved a fact! This game definately hits home with things i want in my game. Innovation on FPS, replayability, and i can play quick session, or long rides. I do only wish that i was not fighting robots and turrents. The literal most boring of enemies!   Its a dark, lifeless, seperated world, cloaked in mystery! Why can't i face demons, or Mr. Smiths or something. Oh well, that is my one complaint and that should not turn you away! Hope you escape this dreamlike world with the knowledge of the reciever!",1,0

393920,Auto Dealership Tycoon,ok first off i love cars and i thought this would be great and my dream job is to run a car dealership.

TO start off i need to say you can only sell your cars for about 500-1500$ over what you bought them for and = YOU CAN NOT SELL USED CAS DO NOT BUY THEM IF YOU GET THIS GAME. if you have 10 used cars for 20000$ less than the normal price the people wont buy them and you loose points if people dont buy your cars which are out of stock because you cant sell any in the first place. There is about 15 cars or less in the game.

Path of Exile deposits you in Wraeclast, with nothing but your wits and a starter weapon to survive with. As you kill enemies and complete quests, your power grows through skill gems and passives. This is all fairly normal for the genre. PoE takes a major departure though by not locking anything to classes. Want a waifish witch wielding a warhammer in warplate? Go for it!  The other exciting part of PoE is the race leagues. These are series of timed events, started with fresh characters in a permadeath setting. Various items are available for points earned when competing and surviving these events.  Finally, Path of Exile is free to play, and not pay-to-win. The only for-pay option which effects gameplay is exxpansion of the shared stash, all other microtransactions are cosmetic only.  All in all, Path of Exile is a great game, whether you want something to pick up every now and again, or to play hardcore in the race leagues and go for glory.",1,0

202170,Sleeping Dogs™,"Probably one of the best open-world style games I've ever played. The only better one I can think of is GTA: San Andreas. The story line of this game is stellar. Awesome combat style. I definitely recommend using a USB controller (Xbox) for easier controls. The only flaw I could think of is, the biggest issue is with its camera. The camera often repositions itself towards center even when you’re using the analog stick to maneuver it while driving. This can significantly complicate navigating tight quarters or getting a look around your vehicle in open spaces. The camera can also be frustrating in some combat situations, though this is far less pronounced. It's not a major flaw, but it's still worth mentioning.

7670,BioShock,"What to say about this game... There's a lot. There were moments of fun, awe, frustration, shock, horror, and even a bit of arousal in the haunted halls of the once great underwater city of Rapture. You start the game as the only survivor of a plane crash, and make your way to a lighthouse. What happens from there is about 10-15 hours (depending on how you play games like these) of exploring a mysterious abanndoned city that's definitely seen better days. Thrust into this land with no knowledge of anything about it, the first scene has you witness a brutal murder by a hyper-mutated freak, a 'splicer'. Your only help is a voice named 'Atlas' through a radio, who's goal is to help you and himself get out of the city alive. Full of twists and turns, a great atmosphere that is CONSTANTLY reminding you that you are in fact underwater, plus, you get to shoot bees out of your hand. There are some problems, and I'm not sure if it's just how the game is or if it's my computer, but at points the game will lag for absurd amounts of time, usually when you're about to hack something, and that can disrupt the flow of action... a lot. Other than that and a bit of a punishing difficulty curve, this game is now one of my favorites and I can't wait to continue the series.  Overall score: 9.3/10, would return to Rapture (and will).",1,0

113020,Monaco,"As many people have said, if you look at the disrecommendations, this game is very easy and boring. However, what those people fail to realize is that, they didn't try hard enough. This game is so boring and simple if you just run through, grab the objectives, and dodge bullets. Now, on the other hand, if you actually go for the achievements, try sneaking through undetected, getting every coin, and not dying, it quickly becomes very difficult and fun. Several people have stated it lacks challenge and strategizing, but that's probably because they played the first levels designed for newcomers, and didn't even try to do good. My friend and I played through the entire game, getting every trophy and achievement, including a hidden one, and it was not easy at several points. For example, in one level, guards spawn every 20 seconds, and form giant conga lines of destruction. Now try sneaking past their unpredictable routes into a guarded room, knocking out the guards without getting seen, so that you can hack a computer and hope that everything works out to let you get through the other 2 rooms, past some lasers, and giving you enough time to grab the cash and get out. My friend and I got rather good at the game and it took us about 30 tries to get lucky on that level. This game has tons of gameplay, and even more replayability with the many character combinations and strategies you can use on each level. I highly recommend this game to anyone.",1,0

220440,DmC Devil May Cry,"I never played the other Devil May Cry games, so this obviously colors my perspective. However, the fanbase of DMC seems rather Japanophilic (and I'm a Silent Hill fan so I know what this affliction can do to fanbases). 'IT ISN'T JAPANEEEZ THEREFORE IT SUCKS' is both terrible logic and the sign of someone trying to feign being educated and sophisticated.  That aside, the plot has some good ideas (the idea of 'Limbo' and the like seems inspired by tabletop RPGs like Kult) although its social/political/economic commentary is about as deep as the kiddie pool. The cliche pseudo-Marxism has me rolling my eyes.  But what makes this game good?  The gameplay is FUN. Seriously, the combat is incredibly fun and fluid and fast. It has depth and variety and tactics yet manages to not be too arcane, the movements and animation are stylish and awesome, and stringing together combos and the like is just a blast. DmC just provides pure flowing hack-n-slash joy.  Also, the visual design is striking.   And the music. Oh man the music suits the game perfectly and totally indulges the rebellious spirit. Its awesome.  So, whether its a 'good DMC game' is something I cannot comment on. Is it a good game? Oh hell yes.  PROS: + Awesome, fun fighting with a good balance of depth and accessibility + Stylish, striking visual design and art direction + Killer soundtack  CONS: - The social commentary can come off as pseudointellectual trash that Fails Economics FOREVER  OVERALL: Turn off the brain. This game is all about fun combat, fun music and awesome aesthetics. And it delivers in spades. And I'd REALLY like the developer to sell replicas of Virgil's coat.   ",1,0

Pros:  -Immersive sky battles -Great Graphics -Good Controls -Good player-base  Cons:  -If you want to do good, you have to fork over a lot of money to the devs -Boring tank battles -No Story -Hackers -Poor balancing    Verdict  With amazing visuals, large scale battles, and fun dogfights, this game may seem like the best free to play game. But it is no where near free, battles bring in little currency, costing you real life money. With-out a story and with unbalanced multiplayer, this game is fun for the first 5 hours, but declines from there.  4/10 - Bad If you have interest in this game, look away.

288040,Actual Sunlight,"Actual Sunlight follows Evan Winters, a man who is in the midst of one hardcore existential crisis. I don't think I'd be wrong to say that much of society today are facing similar feelings and thoughts as Evan. I have read articles on many kids and young adults that are dealing with depression and suicidal ideation and unfortunately, too many go through with it. So I know this game will hit too close to home for many who give it a shot. It's not so much a game, however, as a character study. What you take from it I would assume is how much you can relate yourself to the protagonist. If you are the literal equivalency of your facebook profile I can only imagine that you would find this game to be a nonsensical story with a whiny main character. If that's what you take from it: congratulations. Your life is perfect. However, if recent stories on rising depression and suicide rates are any indication then you would be in a miniscule percentage of the human populace. That is why I think this game is important. Sure, we're making strides on 'anti-bullying' campaigns but nobody is really touching these issues.   For kids in school with 'no friends' and teenagers transitions into adulthood who are now getting socked in the head with their first existential crisis, and for all of those soon-to-be thirty somethings who feel like they've wasted their lives, I implore you, the next time something nice happens in your life take it in stride. Much of life is unhappiness. But those little things are what keep us going. Sure, you may die alone and depressed, but what about all of those great games you've played? What about that totally sweet thing you did the other day that totally mattered to you?  When you play this game remember that it is not you. It's a character study and a damn good one. I wouldn't exactly call it 'art' but I would certainly say it's important. It does what creative writing majors are taught never to do and that's to make your protagonist way too ♥♥♥♥ing depressed. This game makes it work and makes it worth playing.",1,0

203770,Crusader Kings II,"I couldnt decide what to write in this review , so im gonna share with you guys my favorite apple pie recipe Enjoy! :  Pastry  2 cups all-purpose flour   1 teaspoon salt   2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons shortening   4 to 6 tablespoons cold water   Filling  1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar   1/4 cup all-purpose flour   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon   1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg   1/8 teaspoon salt   8 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples (8 medium)   2 tablespoons butter or margarine   1) In medium bowl, mix 2 cups flour and 1 teaspoon salt. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).  2) Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling.  3) Heat oven to 425°F. With floured rolling pin, roll one pastry round into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side.  4) In large bowl, mix sugar, 1/4 cup flour, the cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Stir in apples until well mixed. Spoon into pastry-lined pie plate. Cut butter into small pieces; sprinkle over filling. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1/2 inch from rim of plate.  5) Roll other round of pastry into 10-inch round. Fold into fourths and cut slits so steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired. Cover edge with 2- to 3-inch strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.  6) Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust, removing foil for last 15 minutes of baking. Serve warm if desired.",1,0

275850,No Man's Sky,"No Man's Sky is an ambitious indie game with a AAA price tag. With this in mind, your expectations may or may not be met.  For an indie game, it's great! The worlds are vast, the feel on each planet is mostly unique. Sometimes, I've come across a couple planets that seem similar, but I've also experienced:  A lifeless rock planet abundant with gold, with floating monolith-like formations A planet with about two dozen different species of animals and a few dozen different species of plants A mostly water planet with small islands of snowy evergreen trees A planet light on flora and fauna, but with many abandoned (and some inhabited) alien spaceships A planet abundant with another expensive resource, but with clues of a different alien civilization all over to discover A planet that appeared barren on the surface, but had a series of interconnected caves FILLED with gorgeous plant life and stalactites  Whether free exploring or following what seems to be a main storyline, this game is great for people who want a slower-paced game that's meant to inspire awe, wonder, and above all, curiosity. I strongly disagree with people who say it's a $5 or $10 game - there's far more to it than other games at that price point. $60 is certainly high for now - I think $40 is sort of fair, and $30 is the definite sweet spot for the value of the game.   Another note - there are different levels of solar systems, with each advancing level requiring fancier spaceship parts to reach. The screenshots shown on this page reflect the planets found at the most challenging to reach solar systems, so they're a little deceiving. I've loved the planets I described above, but don't expect to see planets like those in the screenshots until you're well into the game.  OVERALL: Controls are a little clunky at times, but mostly fine. Occasional frame drops are promised to be resolved through patches, and don't make the game unplayable in the slightest. The planets I've seen have been gorgeous in their own unique way and I love exploring what each planet holds. 6/10 at the current price, but at $30 would be a 9/10",1,0

19900,Far Cry 2,"I still haven't beaten the game. I did all the sidequests I could before the main story missions, and then halfway through the (rather thin) storyline, the map suddenly and unexpectedly doubled in size. But before I went any further, I wanted to come in here and say just two things about why I'd recommend this game:  1) Yes, it's sometimes annoying when (a) your car gets shot to bits and (b) the enemies are rushing you with semi-automatic shotguns and (c) you need to take your malaria medication and (d) you can't find safe cover to rip the bullet out of your arm and (e) your weapon jams and (f) that fire you started is licking at your heels ... but when all of these things happen at once, it's some of the most exciting FPS-play I've ever had. Far Cry 2 is full of variability, randomness, and multiple approaches, and the game is at its most thrilling when things go wrong.  2) The world is just beautiful, and the developers work to immerse you in it. It fits together so well; it's explorable for its own sake; and the weather effects are lush. That heavy equatorial sun desaturates everything, and makes the air feel thick as you tromp through towns and jungles. The nights are cool and mysterious, particularly driving over sand dunes in the moonlit desert on the edges of the map. And when it rains, turning everything gray, it feels as refreshing as the end of an IRL drought. I'm playing on a laptop with an integrated chipset and the settings turned down to medium so the game stays smooth, but I still find myself smashing F12 to take a dozen screenshots every hour. That said, enjoying this takes the right frame of mind. If you can be patient and appreciative, you'll love it. But if you lament a lack of Elder Scrollsy fast-travel, maybe not.  The only caveat I'll give: if you insist on playing a hero, this isn't the game for you. Nearly everyone you interact with is a despicable, heartless human being. Bandits, mercenaries, murderers, drug peddlers, tyrants, human traffickers, corrupt officials. And you'll be the worst one of the bunch, like it or not.",1,0

50130,Mafia II (Classic),"Midway through my second playthrough prompted me to wholly recommend this title. I would give it a 92% out of 100.   A 'sorta-sandbox' type game that isn't quite as open as Grand Theft Auto, but does occasionally have you 'on-rails', has you working your way up the ranks of a Mafia family in 1940's and 50's New York City, (called Empire Bay). The main combat uses a cover system much like Gears of War or Rainbow Six Vegas.   While the cover system's usual ' cover / wait / shoot / repeat ' mechanic is nothing new or anything revolutionary, the story of Mafia II makes this game stand out like no other. A rich cast with great voice acting really pulls you into the environment and makes you care about their outcomes.  Gritty adult themes, language and situations make me only recommend this for adults only. But if you were a fan of any mafia style movies (Godfather, Goodfellas, Casino etc.) I cannot recommend this title enough.   Cheers, Dr. Y.",1,0

I say near-complete, because there are occasions when the staff makes an appearance, but those are extremely rare occurances.   I would love to recommend this game, but i simply cannot. I have logged almost 2000 hours into this game, and i've watched it mostly degrade in that time.

The imagery in the game is beautiful and twisted. Some scenes are wonderfully gorgeous, while other scenes are ruthlessly violent. I'm not really a screenshots kinda person, but I did end up taking a lot of screenshots of this game. And the hair physics...you wouldn't think something so small as which way Alice's hair blows in the wind would be such a big deal but it is surprisingly pleasant to watch during those moments when I stop to smell the roses.  The platforming complexity is decent. Hardcore types might be turned off because the path forward is relatively linear and the puzzles themselves are relatively straightforward, but it's still a satisfying experience. Especially because this game has not frustrated me even once, which is surprisingly difficult for games in this genre.  The fighting isn't incredibly complex and the moveset is fairly limited, but it does give you four different weapons, fast melee, strong melee, fast ranged, strong ranged. Some attacks work better than others against some enemies. The fighting adds a nice break between platforming segments; I don't grumble when a fight starts, but I don't get all excited either.  For the completionist, there are lots of little things to look for that are hidden away. I'm usually pretty thorough at searching for things and I've managed to miss two or three things in each level (out of about 30-40). Fortunately, the game allows you to replay previous chapters you've beaten, so you can get a perfect score.",1,0

And it all bleeds in to be something I look forward to more then any AAA game. The story is the oldest thing humans love to share, and it forms the core of much of our culture and being. So it delights me that the stories coming from this author and many like them are starting to reflect all the changes and interesting new developments our world has gone through.

281990,Stellaris,"What is it? - The idea of the game is to start with 4X games like Civilization - Then once all space are colonized / controlled by empire border, it turns into 'Grand strategy' game. i.e. like Crusader Kings or Europa Universalis with extensive diplomacy - The end game is fighting the 'Fallen Empire', ridiculously advanced AI controlled race.  Positive: - Many Unique Spins to the old genre  1. Randomized Tech Tree ('Deck of Card, randomly pick 3, Player choose 1, deck reshuffled)  2. Survey Ship giving 'Anomalies' (i.e. Chain of quests)  3. War Goals (I was told this is like other Paradox games, which I never bothered to play)  4. Extensive Diplomacy option  5. Extensive 'Leaders' and personality which affects everything they interact with  6. Ethics and Divergence: Your population , especially those in distant planet, may believe  in different things and start to build their own fully functioning, independent empire  7. Technology like Genetically modifying pre-sentient race you find into sentient creatures  8. Ability to Research the debris of your destroyed enemies and reverse engineer their techs.  9. Real time (no turn based) game allows for easier multiplayer (no waiting for everyone else's turns) 10. Ability to create 'Federation', with 'Federation Fleet' controlled by the Federation president. The Federation fleet has the bech Technologies from all federation members! 11. Wormhole FTL (faster than light) travel. Hyperlane and Warp are similar to Gal Civ / MOO, but Wormhole is unique. You create a wormhole station,and you can create a two ways wormhole in space for your fleet to go through and back. Gamewise this mean you can pop up BEHIND ENEMY LINES and avoid the usual 'Strong Border, Weak Core' strategy.   Negative: - Sector AI is HORRIBLE. It builds very slowly compared to the resource it have and you cannot command it to build any ships. Since your 'CORE WORLD' (i.e. world you can control directly) is limited to between 5-10 (start with 5; increase with research), you will want to MOD this game to increase that number.  - Tachyon Lance is Overpowered. Lazers Pew Pew Pew. Everyone died at range 120. GG.   (All the above supposedly fixed by October 2016 in patch 1.3. Fingers Crossed)  - Limited Ship models, I'm sure Paradox will sell 400 types of DLC for it.  - Ships cannot be controlled directly by player; and at the end there is little strategical option other than your fleet composition and AI behaviour (Swarm or Bombardment, etc)  - Hidden Complexities: You will need to read a lot of Wikipedias to min-max this game. The fact that there is a 10% penalty to research speed for each planet you have and 1% penalty per population you have is not being shown explicitly and easy to miss (would you realise if a 2400 research becomes 2540 research when you build new colony?)  - Random deck of Tech means that I have to research quite a lot of unwanted tech until I finally draw the technology card I want or desperately need. e.g. if you make a noob mistake of not picking technology that allows you to build Colony ship on your first choice, then you are stuck with no expansion capability for a long, long time.  - After doing the same quests from anomalies for the 100th time (a few are buggy, like Throne of God), it gets boring. The idea of having to research alien language for each alien you meet is just another 90 days delay to game's progress.   -All are interesting idea (like Polution in Master of Orion 4 recently released), but ends up just like another boring micromanagement. I want more of the ability to control my army at strategic level like Commander Adama in Battlestar Galactica and less building another hydroponics farm or risking my stupid Sector AI governor starving my people to death.  CONCLUSION: Paradox is known for developing patches for months to years after the game and for listening to the customers on what need to be fixed and improved. They cater to a very hardcore strategy gamers who would still play their games even if it is lacking completely in graphics department (i.e. Total War in Space this ain't).  But by far this game has potential to be their most popular game (it is their bestselling as far as release date sales so far). In this games they bothered making it pretty with 3D world and battles. In this game they bothered to make tutorial (VIR) clippy. This is probably their most accessible strategy game (unless you count Magicka).  On the plus side, they are famous for making diplomatic games. With a bit of imagination, this can simulate your grandest of space opera role playing - after all, every trait and personality are depicted by numbers: relationship status, ethics and edicts. And if you are not into immersion, you can always play this like a normal 4X games and conquer the universe as usual.  I think the game is reasonably solid as it is, it has STRONG FOUNDATION. You can get 100-200 hours easy without complain just expanding and conquering the universe. Playing passive, as in all 4X games, is not too smart - but Technology cap means at least you won't be both outsized and outsmarted). Paradox call this 'Tall Empire' vs 'Wide Empire'. At least for now, as usual in all strategy games from Total War to MOO4, wide empire is easier.  What excites me is the potential this game can be in a year from now. When they actually add enough ethics specific or race specific technologies into the deck so you won't run out the 'samey' old tech every game; when they fix the sector AI and enemy AI to make them tougher (the AI is already one of the better one in the market as it is), when they kept adding contents, refinement and fixes. This game could be great. But even as it is, this game is good!",1,0

202750,Alan Wake's American Nightmare,"If you liked Alan Wake you may or may not like American Nightmare. The game was okay, had an intresting plot, tons more weapons, spiders, taken that look even worse than in Alan Wake etc. American Nightmare unlike the first game is not a survival horror game, its more an action based game. The plot takes place in the popular tv show 'Night Springs' in an epsode written by Alan himself were the champion of light (Alan) must defeat the herald of darkness (His Evil Twin Mr Scratch). The game takes place in three places: The Motel/Rest Stop, The Observatory and The Drive-in Theater and upon reaching the end of the Drive-in Theater Mr Scratch sends Alan back to the start meaning you have to play through the game again with small differences, this happens twice, in other words, there are Three Areas and Three time loops. The third loop adds the giant, long story short they're scary. In my opinion the game was mostly good but I didn't like the weapon unlock system because they required pages which I sucked at finding. I also didn't like where the game was set and I would take Bright Falls over this. Also spiders.",1,0

221380,Age of Empires II (2013),"I have literally played this game probably a thousand times. First as a teenager, starting off with the download-version, then buying the hard copy. Now I've bought it on Steam and I still discover new things! (and of course, ACHIEVEMENTS!)  Did you know that you don't always start off with sheep? That sometimes you get turkeys? Yes? Me too. BUT!! Did you know that sometimes, you don't get sheep, you don't get turkeys, sometimes....... you get llamas. And, even more rarely, you get cows! Brand new information, thought I'd share it with the world :-)",1,1
253710,theHunter Classic,"When I started this game, I didn't know what to expect. I started running into the grassy field in front of me, and found nothing, even after 20 minutes. I questioned this 'walking simulator', however crouched down, and started walking much slower. A few minutes later, I heard a deer call, and being a novice, simply walked toward it ( I didn't know yet that you are equipped with a tracker that locates where the deer was) I pulled out my rifle and scoped in to the general vicinity that I believed the deer to be. Shortly, I saw it in my sights. I took careful aim, fired, and completely missed. The deer ran away, and I didn't get a kill that hunt.  All in all, I absolutely adore this game. The gorgeous wild beauty mixed with the enjoyable tracking and hunting of your animal makes this game incredibly fun-for me at least. See, this game isn't a game where you get kills every other minute, this is a game in which up to hours of time climaxes in one moment where you have your animal in your sights. If you blow the shot, you can expect a minimum of 20-30 minutes either tracking the same animal down, or looking for a different beast all together.   Another thing about this game that puts people off is the price tag. Although the game itself is F2P, you have to buy hunting licenses for all animals expect the Whitetail deer. Furthermore, the only viable way to get equipment such as deer odor (to conceal your scent from the deer's) or a tent (to start your hunt at a place which you placed your tent in previous hunts) alongside rifles, shotguns, and handguns;is to pay occasionally large sums of real money. For some, this is the ultimate turn off. I believe it to be irritating that you have to pay for this content, however I am still content with the game itself.(See what I did there?)   9/10 for a solid, realistic, and accurate hunting game with a few flaws.",1,0

208730,Game of Thrones ,"The game is a mix of GoT epic storyline and Kotor combat engine.You assume the role of 2 noble characters that fight against all the corruption of Westeros.The game is great if: -You like Kotor -You like GoT -You like totally unexpected plot twists(A song of Ice and Fire style)  The only problem with the game( at least with my style) is the lack of balance between characters.Their skills were opposites and i found myself changing difficulty settings between chapters.The 2 men don't complement each other well and one was OP'ish while the other one was frustratingly weak.(the first char you play is the OP'ish one)  The story is,like A song of Ice and Fire itself filled with 2-3 characters you love and a army of evil and corrupt idiots that you want to turn into your darts target.The plot twists were really unexpected(really,the last thing you could expect) and characters *spoiler*(read this reversed) daed yats ot tnaw t'nod *end spoiler*  Really great way to immerse yourself in the world,as the game was canonised by RR Martin himself.The near-turn based style complements the scene,putting fast paced action and slow motion scenes into the ...decently... made scene.Lacking the great graphic efects of ,say,Skyrim,it immerses the player through Story.   Warning,you may experience dreams of torturing characters from the game,if that happens,DON'T PANIC!Its normal for Game of Thrones stuff.  9,75/10.

444970,Spatial Sound Card,"Update(After Comment by Tom- Developer): It seems software is FINALLY working now. I had a bit of trouble trying to figure out what to use it on- finally settled on Bioshock Infinite- and let me tell you- playing it without and with, is night and day! Have the SSC set to 7.1 Shanghai Beyerdynamic DT 770M, and it just envelopes you in the surroundings- every scream, gunshot, broadcast- even the wind, you are totally aware of it suddenly. Glad I was convinced to give this another try :)   For those of you having problems with still distorted audio and the like- ensure you're playing music, or software with high enough fidelity. I usually import my music at 320K and iTunes automatically splits it into stereo- this becomes obvious upon playback when using this software, as the software is stripping the stereo channels into separate channels, and it doesn't sound very good- not the software's fault- just something to keep in mind-GIGO (Garbage-In-Garbage-Out).   tldr; I would complately recommend this software now- seems like most kinks are worked out, and it's a good deal for more immersive gaming.  _____________________________________________________________________________________________  Update (A week later):  I have received no reply from dev either from this review, or from the discussion page as dev had requested. I am requesting a refund. A word of advice, until issues are fixed and or dev starts fixing the problems, I would recommend holding off on this.   Original: Sorry, I also cannot get this APP to work, even after I read that the dev had released an update to bind to WASAPI, but I figured I'd give it a try. I could also not get this to work after I installed the trial version directly from New Audio Technology, but I figured I'd give this version a shot- especially with the dev saying he updated it.   Problems (If you care to read): Cannot get sound to output through headphones using software as default playback device- unless I run the software in stereo mode (which kinda' defeats the purpose I must admit). The only way I'd been able to get the software to work otherwise is to go into recording devices, and set my headphones to 'listen' to this recording device on playthrough... this also defeats the purpose, as it does not allow controlling of sound directions- it just patches through.   For reference I'm running Windows 10- using Steelseries Siberia V2 headset (USB). I watched some Youtube Videos on this software, and the demonstrations are incredible! I'm sure if this software would work properly it would be amazing. Dev- you seem great like you're working on stuff, I'm willing to try anything if you have any ideas- I tried looking up my problems online and couldn't seem to find anything. I'll certainly update my review if any fixes are made.",1,0

232890,Stronghold Crusader 2,"Missing features or bad decisions: - AI is too bad. They only attack in same way whole game. - No forced attack - No moat (Srsly Firefly? No moats?) - Can't pick which kind of lord (arab/european) you play in Sandbox mode or options - No 45 degree rotation for buildings, which was one of the VERY few good things in SH3 - You can't determine which goods, and how many, your estates deliver - Bird's-eye view missing (Very important! Especially for building) - All the lists are missing, like the ones showing all your units, where your gold came from etc. etc. - Where is the map maker? - Can't close/open gates on your own - TOWERS DON'T GET DOORS WHEN WALLS ARE ATTACHED TO THEM!! (this really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, as I am a person who cares a lot about such details, which is why I really stressed this point when I made my suggestions list for SHC2 while it was still in development) - There is no restart button - Building limit and unit limit is WAY TOO LOW - When you play with 8 players the unit limit is WAY too low. What am I supposed to do with 140 units? Even after only 3 players were left, I could still just build 333 units, that's not enough to be fun! - Same as above goes for buildings too, the limit is way too low - Couldn't find a strong walls option when playing against NPCs - Walls are TOO WEAK!!! One guy on Metacritic said it feels like they're made of chalk, which is absolutely true. They are in fact so weak that they're pretty much useless, combine that with the missing moats and you can't have any decent defense - Horses die way too easily, which makes knights almost useless. I once sent a large group of knights into an enemy group of archers, and most of them lost their horses before arriving. They need to be a LOT stronger - the marker on the minimap that shows where you currently are is too hard to see, it's very thin and black, should be changed to red or something - When you click on a unit that was sent out to attack someone or something, you can't see what he's going to attack, the marker should come back - Peasants and workers don't talk anymore - I really miss that one feature from SH2 where you could zoom out farther, but couldn't build anything while you did it (the button was an eye in a red circle or something like that). It was nice to be able to see your whole castle in that mode - No torture buildings (or the opposite of them) - Not enough new soundtracks - I don't mind using a few good, old ones, but I've only heard like 1 or 2 new soundtracks as of now  Found in other threads: - No ladder men or siege towers - Only one kind of keep    Other Bugs:  • Siege camps • Walls aren't deleted properly • Unresponsive units (they don't listen sometimes) • Camera 'jumps' sometimes when moving around the map • Some video options glitch the graphics, lines in middle of screen and such • Ranger animations are messed up - they hold the bow sideways away from them leaving one hand empty...  Suggestions:  • Fix UI • Add usable gates • Engineers, add them • Remove siege camps • Soldiers walking from camp site to barracks • Replace defensive turrets with old ones • Stronger walls • Nerf range on fire throwers • Nerf arabian archers (their range is insane compared to regular archers) • Up the damage from fire • Voiced peasants • Bring back the videos for buildings (doesn't matter if you rip them directly from Crusader, they look great) • Longer peace time (60 minutes) • Less slashing animations for pikemen (it feels odd) • Remove negative popularity from random events • Remove ALL events when turned off (including winds) • Count build distance with player keeps instead of areas • If areas are kept, increase color opacity • Add numbers on players and their keeps when choosing a map • Target your own units with attack • Round towers • Improve menu UI...The font, oh the font... • Perhaps fix the Rat, he feels way too gentleman like, dumb him down • Fix AI so they can actually defend their castle and attack in a proper way • Increase building and unit size. Remove buildings already present on map to increase this? • More NPCs running around - chickens, drunks, peasants, kids to make the place feel more alive",1,0

The devs  really  need to get someone to proofread this game.    Repetitive gameplay. Remember I said earlier that this game was inspired by Naruto? So the kage (head of the village) will give you a mission, along with a pre-determined party member. You completed the mission, got some reward from him and that's it. That's how you spend your day.    Money. As you progress in the game, it becomes increasingly easy to get money and during those 4 hours in the game, I've never had any money problem.    Unbalanced. My entire party could literally wipe out an entire enemies in one turn without mana (or chi) problem.  Just go to the pentagram symbol. Pay 10 golds and voila! No more mana and health problem. Rinse and repeat to grind.     Naruto inspired game? Nah. This game is way too similar to be called 'inspired by' (Though the devs never mention that). Only with a little bit difference here and then. Bell mission with Kakashi and team 7? Check. The drama between Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke? Check.     Max. By the time you reached lvl 15, he'd stop leveling up. Wait what? No, you didn't hear me wrong. He literally stopped leveling up because by then the game wouldn't be able to handle his power. Hell, I'm not even gonna be surprised if he already awakened his mangekyo.  ",-1,1

222880,Insurgency,Insurgency is a game for what i have been waiting for so long !! A fast paced shooter with realistic gunplay and hardcore gameplay ! This mix is working great and this game is a lot of fun !  Good thinks !  + Guns feel amazing and every kill makes you ♥♥♥ ! + Very nice graphic.Yeah its not frostbite but what do you want from a indie deveployer ? + Very tactical ! You need to use smokes and flank the enemie very often witch gives you a tactical feel ! +Amazing costumization mode ! Its like in Csgo where you get Money at the beginning and you can buy equipment for it  ! Well Insurgency has a very similar system.You get a amount of points you can spend for equipment witch works just great ! Do you want to get a sniper scope on your Ak-74 ? Or do you want AP bullets and a handgrip for the same amount of points ? You choose ! +Very nice and detailed Maps ! +Differend playstiles for each Weapon and equipment ! If you have a scope on your Ak than you need for sure snipe the enemy ! If you have smokes than you need to flank the enemy ! If you use an LMG than you need cover your teamates or dont let the enemy get to a position ! +Alot of differend gamemodes witch needs alot of differend requirements from your playstile. +Quite a lot of differend weapons. +An amazing community with friendly and helpfull players ! (MOSTLY)  The bad thinks  - Sometimes very frustrating balance ! Some of the maps are way to unfair for the Insurgents and Some are way to unfair for the American Capitalist pigs ! Balance is the biggest problem in this game  - Only like 1000-2000 people play this game. Its enough to find a very good full server but still im scared that the community will die in the future  And that was it ! The game is fully worth for the full price because of the amazing experimence you can get.  ,1,0

261030,The Walking Dead: Season Two,"While in the last game, we played as Lee, an intelligent, strong, adult male, this time, the playable character is Clementine, the young girl who we spent a large part of the last season protecting. Clem is still no more than ten years old, and the way that potentially changes how the player will interact with the world in this season is exciting. For her age, Clementine is certainly quite clever and strong, but the world of The Walking Dead is full of monsters, zombie and otherwise, and there's no question she's more vulnerable and less powerful than Lee was. One of the challenges of this is balancing between giving the player agency in the world without giving Clem influence she shouldn't have from a narrative point of view. This is going to have to be a very different story, and with the setup, it's somewhat hard to see how it will pay off the way the first season did, but we'll have to wait and find out. In terms of gameplay, very little has changed from the first season. Most of the important interaction comes from dialogue choices, with QTEs and a few simple fetch quests tossed in to break things up. Like in the original, you will sometimes have to make some tough choices, and the game will keep track of how you choose, leading to slightly different situations. I sometimes miss the more difficult puzzles found in Telltale's earlier titles such as Tales of Monkey Island, but their more recent games seem to be going for a different type of genre, so it's probably best not to make direct comparisons. This is less an adventure game and more of a visual novel, albeit one that does a very good job of keeping the player within the lines while simultaneously making them feel like the story is their own. Perhaps things will change up in later episodes, but I don't really think they have to if the main concept is pulled off properly. screen1136x1136-9 From a technical standpoint, well, this is an iOS version of a Telltale game, so things aren't going to be completely airtight. In particular, I should give a clear warning to people on older hardware. If your hardware was not officially supported but could run the first season in some fashion anyway, don't count on the same here. Things went pretty smoothly on my iPhone 5S, but I've seen tons of complaints from people on circa-iPhone 4 tech. Given Telltale's history, don't count on much technical support after the fact, either. One thing that did work quite well is the save game import. As long as you kept the first season on your device, you'll be able to import your final data for that. There aren't many ramifications in the first episode apart from the 'Previously' opening, but I'm sure things will come into play in less subtle ways eventually. From here, I'll write up a bit about each episode as they're released. As with the main review, I'll do my best to avoid spoiling anything current when talking about each one, but there may be spoilers for prior episodes as we go along. Tread at your own risk!",1,0

There just a problem, and it's not that small and it's the price of the game with the DLC that you need to play it.

8800,Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword,"Best expansion for the best PC game out there. The base game, Civilization IV, is great. It is a really in depth 'civilization simulator.' You take control of a civilization starting at the dawn of time all the way to the modern era and beyond. The game is very in depth with all of the options at your disposal for how you manage your government, economy, religion, espionage, foreign policy, and many other factors. You can be Gandhi and set up a fascist theocracy with a socialist economy and nuke everyone on the planet. There is a lot of literature out there about how spectacular this game is so I’ll just stop here.  One of the few flaws is the combat. It is all percentage based, so you can get in some pretty frustrating situations. Maybe you go into a battle where you have and 80+ percent chance of winning, but there is still a chance you can lose. Even at 97+percent I’ve lost some times. This combat system is extremely frustrating when you “get haxed” and lose on battle you should have won. Another issue is that in late game the combat really just becomes “who can have the most units crammed into a tile.” Your (and your opponents’) empire will get so big and have so much production that it becomes quite cumbersome to manage a war with all the military units you’ll have around. Since you can fit literally infinite units in one space, it really becomes a contest of who can get the biggest army and march from city to city. These flaws pale in comparison to how great and addicting this game is, however.  This expansion, beyond the sword, is the best. It adds even more units, buildings, and civilizations to the game. Also, it comes pre-loaded with some of the best mods, including Rhye’s and Fall of Civilization, which takes this game to a whole new level. Over all it’s as close to a 10/10 game I have ever seen. You won’t regret spending the money to buy this, especially when it is on sale.",1,0
257750,Bloody Trapland,"Rage Quit Simulator 2016  This game has more blood than an average Tarantino movie, and can f*ck your mind up easily.

Mostly because you can kill your friends prevent them from complete the level. The menu is a bit messy, for me finding how to play multiplayer was a pain, joining through Steam doesn't work.

214490,Alien: Isolation,"This is utterly terrifying. I first played the game in 2014 when it first came out which then only had Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulties available. While I played it on normal it was still very tough to get through. The AI for the Alien truly makes it an enemy like no other. You'd think you'd be tailing it as it walks down a corridor until suddenly, and without warning, it'll turn it's head in your direction then you're Alien chow. Or you'd walk along another section and hear the Alien thumping around in the vent, to all of a sudden drop down right in front of you.  When this game first came out I thoroughly enjoyed it as it really sells that retro-future ascetic used in Ridley Scott's first film Alien. A lot of people I've seen play this call the first Alien film a 1980's film. It's not. Production started in 1977 and was released in 1979. The decor and architecture of browns and greys was 'the thing' back in the day. That makes the film a 1970's film, not the physadelic colors of the 80's. Yet another look this game nails. Wondering around the Torrens and Sevastopol station you'll see many reminders of where this game gets its backbone from. The seats and walls are emblazoned with the drab 2-tone covers, the monochromatic monitors displaying text and basic graphics common in 1960's and 1970's computers.  And then, and THEN the music starts playing. The music is adaptive to your situation. In an area devoid of enemies you'll usually hear a calming melody which sets the mood that, yes, while you are in a dangerous environment you're not alone and not in immediate danger. But then the alien gets near, you hide, the alien gets nearer still, then the music changes. The trombones and horns start singing as you hind in that locker or under a table, you can't move and only hope the alien will move on. And in a couple of sections of the game you'll even hear little ditties that came straight from the original firm to further emphasise you're in space and deep in the Xeno-verse.  The vanilla game is truly epic with some only a couple of scripted scenes with the alien, the alien is pure unfettered AI looking, sniffing for you. A really tough challenge is to play the game on Nightmare difficulty, however as I write this review, I've started playing the game yet again this time with the Unpredictable Alien and No Motion Tracker mods. It's bad enough the alien is 'somewhere', and the motion tracker can only approximate it's position especially in maps with multiple levels to it, but try playing this game with only audio clues to try and keep tabs on the alien as it scuttles each level you're on.  The game isn't without faults though. Bipedal NPCs seem 'stiff' while walking. No so great when seeing humans walk like that but is a great effect on the Working Joes. Talking of which, the game is called Alien: Isolation, not Attack of the Working Joes. There's far too many in game, though like in Deus Ex are best left alone as they can be really tough to take down without the right tools, and neigh on impossible if they don't like you while the Alien is nearby.  Voice acting is film quality but while in-game (not when a cut scene is being played out) lip-syncing is a hit-and-miss. Though that's not a problem on the 'Joes as they have no lips to sync. There are also a few missions where you have to traverse the same map 2 or 3 times, I'm not talking about maps you play early in game you have to play later on in the story with different enemies oh no. I'm talking about you enter a level, you get set a waypoint on the map (not available in Nightmare difficulty) for the exit, you get there but the exit is locked. So you have to go to another point on that same map, do something and return to that exit. I understand Creative Assembly are trying to keep the tension up by prolonging it for as long as possible but it can get very tedious for speed runners.  I love the Aliens franchise and this is THE DEFINITIVE Alien game for any one who loves the lore like I do. A masterpiece on it's own, but with the few mods that are available, you can make it so much more terrifying like never before.",1,0

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"This review solely include my opinions on the multiplayer portion of the game.  I think after ten hours of gameplay, I have an overall feel of how the multiplayer fairs.  Here are my general thoughts:   When I first started the game and had to pick my first specialist, I thought: What are these? As I read further into them my stomach sunk, but still, I was eager.   Pressing further into my first match I was happy to find it was fun. I liked it. Guns handled about how I would expect them to - tight and solid. The maps too were also quite balanced, especially in domination. But that's about all I liked.   Wall running, parkour, what have you - to me this is the weakest mechanic in the game. Yes, it works well almost 100% of the time. Only exception being when you clip around a corner and fall of an edge, you just begin sprinting along side the wall. While annoying, it is something easily overlooked. Additionally, when you're in a firefight and start wall running, it snaps your view, jolting it away from your target and getting you killed. Those with fast reflexes may be able to manage swinging the gun around back in time.   Another big gripe I have with the game are specialists. (turns out that feeling in my gut wasn't the leftover beef.) How should I say this? They're overpowered? No, not quite. Rather, their abilities are overpowered. For example Ruin's ability is to leap in the air and ground pound. Killing everyone within the radius. Sparrow has a bow which not only is a one-shot, it explodes. Even if she misses, the likelihood of you dying is still quite high. Same deal with Prophet. He has a railgun with a fast buildup and one-shot. Specialists are highly lethal and you can't do anything about them. Run around the wrong corner and boom, you're dead without even seeing the aggressor.   Overall, I find the game enjoyable. That's it. Would I recommend the game? No. While ambitious, I think Treyarch walked too much a similar path as Sledgehammer. Hopefully Infinity Ward is able to redeem my trust next year with their installment in the ever growing franchise. I don't want to wait another three years to buy one of my most loved franchises.",-1,0

48720,Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword,"Its far from as good as Mount &amp; Blade warband.  What i felt most disapointing was the singleplay. Sure it has some new mechanics but i didnt find them any good or fun. Also you don't get those epic and fun fights like you do in warband. Becuse you spend most of the fights hiding behind a rock, tree or your soldiers so you wont get one shot by some random rifleman 100m away.  The rifle combat is so awful. The rifles are very strong so you can often get suprised killed by anyone. Useing a rifle yourself is even worse since the bullet can fly anywere. So shooting becomes more of luck then a skill. With the high relode time just makes it worse. If you want to fight with rifles in a mount and blade game i recomend the napolic dlc for warband. Becuse the rifles are more accurate so its more skill based, It feels more epic with music and cannons, I think relode is faster or atlest it feels faster.   I only got the hours on the game becuse the melee combat in multiplayer was the one fun thing.",-1,0

Next there are glitchy animations, the sky never glitched in any version or source port of quake I had. My sega saturn has smoother texture animation than this port. This is basically GLquake and Winquake packaged together with the core files. No effort whatsoever. You would think with this one game being the grandfather to Valve and the entire Steam storefront operation they would pay respectful homage. No. I feel ripped off. Bad Valve, Bad Steam. No Megusta. The least you could do is make a free-to-play Quake: Source package like TF2. That would be truely respectful and fitting. Oh right, ID's basically owned and being dryhumped now though.

202970,Call of Duty: Black Ops II,"I have been a Call of Duty fan since Infinity ward's Call of Duty 1 and United Offensive, and Black Ops 2 shows Treyarch's extreme Capabilty of making amazing games across all platforms. Black Ops 2 is in my opinion the BEST Call of Duty to date. Treyarch stepped away from the usual Call of Duty formula and set out to try many new approaches in this game and in my opinion have successfully made each approach awesome.   The new engine that Black Ops 2 runs on is just Gorgeous!!!The overall graphical fidelity and the colour pallet are so beautiful. It's the best graphical experience in CoD history. The capability of the game running so well on lower end graphics cards just amazes me.  The fact that you change between 2025 and the Cold War in the campaign gives you such an amazing blend of old and new and makes you feel like you are in Black Ops 1 for some moments. The Campaign has lets u make vital choices which change the course of the game. There are 6 different endings, a first for the Call of Duty franchise.  The Zombie mode is the best it's ever been, especially with the dynamic map Tranzit. The concept of having to complete objectives in Zombies is just spectacular as it complicates the gameplay positively and allows you to think about about which player should do whuch objective.  The Multiplayer is THE BEST Call of Duty Multiplayer experience you can have! A wide variety of amazing weapons and gadgets, Beautiful and well designed maps (including a modern remake of Nuketown) and ease of use match joining system is fantastic! I can click find game - TeamDeathmatch and within seconds I'm in a local game with a very low ping.",1,0

363680,Battlefleet Gothic: Armada,"I was really excited when this came out and I tried to give it a chance. However, the blantant imbalance between factions really kills where the game matters most in multiplayer. Not only are factions imbalanced, but unless you already have a top-tier fleet you will get pummeled by other players who have maxed out cheese builds.   It is a shame because I really love the core mechancics of the game. It looks beautiful and the core design really captures the tabletop game of old. However, the devs (or I suspect GW) just want to push the name and not a good product. Typical of GW-licensed video games sadly.   If you want a fleet combat game I would look elsewhere (not that there are many options out there).",-1,0

493340,Planet Coaster,"Nominated this game for the 'Whoa, dude' nomination during the 2016 Autumn Sale!   I'm pretty glad with the resurgence of alternative competitor titles nowadays that completely took advantage from the greedy corporations that bought some top franchises from the past. If you know the Simcity fiasco from EA that later got rekt from a competitor through Cities Skylines, then Planet Coaster is your way to go if you're one of those long-time fans who got dissapointed with Rollercoaster Tycoon World.  Although this game might feel a bit unfinished in certain aspects such as the managment, Planet Coaster focuses more on your creativity. You're given set pieces that you can use to build whatever you please using your imagination (and some wonky controls). But seeing how positive the devs responded to the community, I have high hopes for future content. I'll be happy to pay for any upcoming DLC to support these devs and help keep the game alive.  Please take note that the game really demands a lot of resources from your PC. Previously I've played this with 4GB RAM (below recommended specs) and I couldn't play when my park starts to get 1500+ peeps, it starts lagging like hell. I decided to buy additional 8GB RAM JUST for this game - and it plays smoothly. So be sure you met the minimum requirements at least to save you from any frustation.  GG Frontier - can't wait to see what you have in store for this game in the future - DLCs, expansions, etc. Good job!  Get this game if you LIKE building and creating things, but do reconsider if you really are looking for complex management stuff, because at the moment the management aspects are a bit too simplified IMO.",1,0

301610,OpenCanvas 6,"Warning! This is a Review of a hobby artist. I have no clue about professional programs. The programs I used before are: GIMP, Photoshop CS6, Photoshop Elements, Paint Tool SAI  After playing around with the program for a couple of hours I have to say... It's simple. But really, the best program, I have ever used to draw. It helps a lot, if you want to draw outlines. Especially with a graphics tablet. With the built in function to smoothen the lines, you will draw perfect lines around the second or the first time trying. In Photoshop, you have to make first a reaaally big picture and draw like this, so you can make it smaller afterwards to hide eventual wobbly lines. Or in SAI, you may be confronted with vector based lines, which are perfect, if you want perfect quality outlines. In openCanvas however, all you need is a stroke with your pen or mouse, and it already looks great.  All the brushes are perfectly adjustable and easy to work with. I was really impressed by the kalligraphy pen, where it took less than a minute to adjust it to my needs, while in Photoshop, it took quite a while and didn't look good after all. Or maybe it was just my imagination. In fact, I was really impressed, how easy this little program works.  I wasn't very sure, what to expect with the filters, when I saw them advertised on the shop page. But they have some really nice little filters, which can twirl the image, make waves, pixelize(mosaic), diffuse in a very smooth way etc. etc.  The user interface is adjustable to the maximum. While it has similarities to how GIMP handles the many windows, it feels a lot more stable in handling and using.  Now one thing, I wasn't really sure if needed. But it came in handy when using. Perspectives. You can practically adjust for very impressive static structures and visual effects. It is for sure damn good to use when you are a beginner and don't draw in perfect perspectives from the beginning of your picture. But I could imagine it to be also really handy for professional artists too. (I think, I will have much fun with it!)  Rotating the picture as you need while drawing makes hard to draw lines easier and you don't have to turn your tablet upside down. Really nice to have this implemented. It is a far nicer rotation tool than GIMP, Photoshop or SAI. Also it is more handy.  The last two things (And I am sorry to put the least good things in the end) You can add text. Well, every other tool I know has this feature. I don't know, why it is worth mentioning. But okay. And.. this is ACTUALLY really neat, if you think about it. The program itself takes up only 18MB. It makes it the smallest, but best program to draw, I own.  Sure, I feel really hyped about this and I will update the review in a few weeks with a speed art and a much more settled opinion. But I hope you liked this review and it helped you considering to buy it. It is worth every dollar/euro/septim/gold coin or whatever you like to buy stuff with.  Here are the prices of the porgrams compared: GIMP - free Photoshop CS6 Standard - 699$ Photoshop CS6 Extended - 999$ Paint Tool SAI - 5400 Yen (Around 50$ And no, it is NOT freeware) openCanvas - 49,99$  If you have questions or want to correct me, just comment and I will try to answer it, correct it or add it to the review if important.  Edit #1: As I am not sure, why my 'play time' is so low, I was quite busy with it. There are actually some bugs, you should be aware of.  - Your stylus may not be recognized after using the arrows to scroll on your drawing. This isn't really a big problem, but can be really annoying after a few hours. You can also solve it by either Alt+Tab out and in again, or by drawing a line with your normal mouse.  - Sometimes, you are not able to load up a .psd file. If you want to keep working on a picture, you have to copy every layer, save it as a separate picture and import it to OpenCanvas. This happened to me only once after switching very often between Photoshop and O.C. Rather use .oci  If you find yourself having the same issues, consider reporting the bug. End of Edit #1",1,1

254700,Resident Evil 4,"Great goodness this port is BAAAD The game is near a decade old but it struggles to play in certain areas so much I had to dumb down my resolution and turn on the 30 fps limit. My Computer is old, but it's not so much a clunker that it should have any reason to run Resi4 horribly.  Capcom dropped the ball again!(you had TWO shots at this port!) They're in my book near Ubisoft in PC ports!   As for the game itself: I have never played RE 4 up until now. I just heard so much hype and praise around it, especially when RE 5 and 6 came out, or any 'personal top games ever' I hear from people. And I would like to say.  They're not wrong. I like this game but I don't 'love' it.  It is a fantastic game yes, and I am enjoying it. Maybe its my personal inability to get hooked or maybe I actually don't like it(probably the former) but this game is in no way bad.  Stuff I like: +Tense... especially when I never played this before and everything is new to me. +Managable. On 'Normal' I've been having to ration ammo but I rarely ever run out to the point where I have to knife everything. +Tank Controls... yeah... the tank controls made it harder to perform fast,precise actions therefore added to the tense 'I GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE!' moments +Inventory Tetris isn't that bad... I kept my inv. clean and never really wound up with the infamous clutter this game is known for  Stuff I didn't like: -Horribad PC Port -Ashley's voice -Ambiguous healing amounts: When I need to heal I sometimes catch myself struggling whether or not the weaker mixed herbs or a single green is enough -Knife distance: Nyeh! NyeH! get closer DAMNIT!!! -Bad Keyboard Mouse... apparently... never really used them cause people told me not to and I defaulted to controller.

203140,Hitman: Absolution,"At first I hated this game, thinking that it 'ruined' the Hitman series, so I left it after the first missions (probably the third one); fortunately, one day I tried it again and I completed it, discovering how cool it actally is. The first half part of the game was pretty boring to me, but then it began really interesting. Sure, there were still some missions which annoyed me (they're the ones where you have to get behind a cover and stay there for a long time in order to escape from a place and reach a new one, without having any targets to kill), but 90% of the rest was really amazing and I felt like playing on older Hitmans. If you're looking for some old-like 'silent' action, missions such as Streets of Hope or The King of Chinatown are the ones which you're looking for. Except for the exaggerated amount of bloom and lens flares which can be very annoying, the rest of the graphics is amazing. Performance is pretty bad, so I wouldn't suggest this game if you have a bad PC and you aren't going to buy a high-end one. Plot is ok/good, but what really surprised me is the longevity. It took me 30+ hours to complete it, even without having done all 'additional objectives' (although I've repeated many times some missions in order to get SA rating). Now, I can say that I'm disappointed for some aspects of the rating system (no penalties for found bodies? What? No timer? Too bad), for the disguise system (they're useless if you don't use instinct), for the exaggeration in the use of covers and for the cover system itself. Recommended!",1,0

372000,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),"Despite a rough launch this is one of the best mmo's I've played in years. The biggest issues right now are the bot infestations and all the typical problems with new servers (lag spikes, dc's etc). The bots are only in the really low level areas but for your first 2 or 3 hours of gameplay you'll sometimes find yourself literally surrounded by them.   The other caveat is that the learning curve is duanting even for a KRPG. One wrong mistake in charcter building and you could easily lose 200 hours of game play.   This is not a casual game. It will punish you severely for ignorance so information is the true in-game currency. On the brightside it's designed so that if you screw up a character then your next one gets a lot of benefits to help you get back to the higher levels in a fraction of the time.",1,1

245170,Skullgirls 2nd Encore,"SKULLGIRLS Developed by: Reverge Labs Lab Zero Games Review by: Aaron Matthew Holmes  Skullgirls, a 2D fighter game developed by Reverge Labs, Lab Zero Games, and published by: Autumn Games, Konami, Marvelous AQL (PC), and CyberFront (Japan), was originally released in April 2012 for the Playstation Network and Xbox Live. The game has recently rereleased on Windows and STEAM systems this year. The game, in a fantasy setting, takes place in the 1940’s post-war America. Skullgirls features 14 characters, one non-playable (Marie), and 5 DLC characters. Skullgirls allows the player to experience single-player and multiplayer battles, however, single player allows the player to view each characters story as they progress through battle after battle.  For the review of Skullgirls, I’ve played through the game with one of the most iconic characters in the game, or at least, one that I’ve seen cosplayed numerous times at conventions; Ms. Fortune. I can’t necessarily avoid spoilers as the game has been out at least a year at this point, so feel free to continue reading past this point, or skip to the end for my overall review/rating of the game.  Skull-Girls-2  Playing through Skullgirls, and selecting one the character Ms. Fortune, it’s immediately seen just how quickly this game is violent, yet comedic at the same time (see above image). Ms. Fortune attempts to intervene with a creepy guy hitting on an innocent waitress, only to be beheaded, however, there is some fort of magic that allows her to control both her body and head even while detached to then attack and beat the crap out of the man. Skull-Girls-3  As the storyline continues, Ms. Fortune finds a strong opponent, known as a “Skullgirl” who possesses strong powers, strong enough that they could grant wishes (at least from my first playthrough and understanding).  Skull-Girls-4  After the battle, Ms. Fortune is presented the opportunity to take control of the same power as the Skullgirl to grant her any wish, but decidedly doesn’t use the, obviously evil, power for that. She decides to continue life as she has.  Skull-Girls-5  I’ll definitely be playing this game, in single player only, with the other characters to see how the other stories turn out and to see what kind of twists there are within each. The developers of this game have found a good balance of storytelling and comedy with this fighting game, and it’s definitely changed my thoughts, positively, on fighting games, if only for this game.  Audio: 4/5 Well used audio, several variations for attacks, hitting, and being hit. Soundtrack is lively and fits with the battles and story scenes. Only thing that’s missing is well-done voice acting to finish this off for a perfect 5.  Story: 4/5 The stories vary from character to character, and are humorous throughout the game. The game does, however, throw you into matches with different characters without explaining why you’re fighting them, or how you encountered them. The game does this with specific battles only it seems.  Controls: 3.5 -&gt; 4.5 My rating on the controls is based off the fact that I’m not a master at fighting games, in fact, I’m a “button masher” who just gets lucky when playing these types of games. The game does offer a tutorial system for battling, but when you need to memorize what key on your keyboard or gamepad matches the in-game ‘key terminology’, it becomes confusing and a game of “let’s see what this button does!”. The controls are much more suited for those who are familiar with the fighter genre and can master combos, skills, and moves with the different characters.  Graphics: 5/5 The graphics in this game are beautiful and well designed, especially when it comes down to the characters themselves. The cutscene artwork, level artwork, and overall graphic design of the game is not inconsistent in any way shape or form, and a great use of the talents of the artists who worked tirelessly on this game.  Overall Score: 4.5/5 This game, while definitely suited toward the Fighter-Game audience, can be played by those with little or no experience, so long as the difficulty is set low enough, and provides a humorous yet enjoyable experience for those who give it a try.",1,0
267530,The LEGO® Movie - Videogame,"One of the most awesomeness games, 9/10 Because the Developers Of this game skipped a few a clips and scenes, But understandable it has good local co-op. It also contains 96 charecters (Not trying to spoil) Some of them were barley even shown on the movie, or video game but are still playable!Lego games that are co-op,adventure and actions are my favorite types, like this one.Also along with lego the hobbit,Marvel Super Heroes,Lord of the rings, Lego batman 1 and 2 and finnaly Lego Harry Potter:Years 1-4 and Years 5-7.This game is pretty funny, you get to wear pants that give you special effects (More Spoils) Like theirs one with a fart effect, (My favorite, must jump for sound effect) a drilling effect,music and those 3 are the only ones im going to say so. BOOHOO TO YOU!Anyway,They also added charecters from Ninjago,Dc Universe and more! (Also Hobbit :3) YOU SHALL NOT PASS!!!! You should know who this guy is if your in a Super Lego FanCLUB like me :3! Also my favorite part, you get to become the villains Like Robots, The Last and final (Powerful) Boss, President Business and LORD Business.Their are also 4 free worlds to explore, including bonus room. (Unlock Bonus Room by completeing games story mode.) So That Means...., Lego Brick Adventures! Their is 20 red bricks......... Sometimes i call them deadpool bricks because i play Lego MARVEL Super heroes to, (I got all of them) Before i go like i said, Overall the game is 9/10 to me, let me hear your thoughts!!!!!!! :_) (Watch the movie first to understand some gameplay or clips) Just a reminder :D",1,0

454650,DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2,"I've really enjoyed my time playing. Had a few issues the first day with the game freezing, but I've been playing on upscaled 4k and even while streaming it sticks at 60 fps. Only other performance issue I had was clothes freaking out skyrim-flying-blackhole-horse-of-doom style, but I had tabbed out for an extended period of time prior to that happening. I enjoyed the story, thought it was pretty cool. I liked the idea of including my previous character and it really made for some cool moments.  Key notes: -Animations Can't say enough here. Things look so damn good. -Graphics Cell shaded, but what the hell did anyone expect? Did feel like the whole thing looked kinda washed out until I adjusted my settings though. -Moves Drastic improvements and a much better selection this time around  About to hit 80 and still enjoying my time punching things.

240760,Wasteland 2,"I found this to be well worth playing, but it left me somewhat unsatisfied in the end and wishing there had been far more content. After finishing one playthrough, I immediately started a new one but quickly realized that the game would not grab my interest enough for a second one any time soon, though it is partially my fault perhaps.  As you can see from my 'hours on record', I finished the game in under 27 hours (subtracting the aborted second playthrough), so I'm not quite sure where they got the 80 hours of gameplay idea from. As noted below, I take shortcuts when playing, but I wouldn't expect those to shave 50 hours off of play time, more like a quarter at most.  As a casual gamer, I very much enjoyed the tactical combat aspect. I actually prefer a 'heroic' gameplay approach in which my squad usually has the tactical upper hand, as opposed to more hard core players who prefer to have to struggle hard to reach objectives (I just don't have time for that - thus part of the reason play time was shorter, but not all the reason IMHO). As such, I tend to tweak player stats early on to give them a bit of an advantage (just a bit!). I actually found that this makes combat far more exciting for me at least. I would very much prefer a game in which one good shot will lay you, or the enemy, flat, as it would in real life, and tweaking stats can create such a situation (unfortunately for the player squad only). I find the concept of spamming heals on party members to survive an encounter to be *extremely* unrealistic and immersion breaking in anything but a fantasy setting, so the tweaked stats allowed be immersive roleplaying of a heroic squad versus more average opponents. I loved the increasingly effective gear replacements and the gun modification mechanics, as well as the various differences in the tactics required for the weapons, which also helped immersion greatly. Someone else here said that gun ranges seemed the same, but for me, the chance to hit was eliminated as a factor through tweaking, so I could see clearly that ranges were in fact quite important. This suggests to me that some tweaking of balance might actually make this game better for some people. Just for comparison, there are plenty of other RPGs I've played in the past, with tweaks/mods/God abilities etc., where long term playability was in no way effected by that. A truly good game should accomodate all sorts of play styles. Anyway, overall, I found the tactical aspect to be the most satisfying part of the game. Being able to preposition my squad and then draw the enemy into a shooting gallery was actually quite fun. Granted, that also points out the weak enemy AI others have mentioned. The AI does more typically rush into their weapon range and then end up unable to fire because they've run out of action points, making them sitting ducks out in the open. However, in situations where they are already in range and under cover, they will remain there, and they did seem to seek cover if it was close by.  I generally do not like scripted games at all. I prefer open world/sandbox almost exclusively, but I make an exception for this genre due to nostalgia from the original Fallout series. Others below have complained about the overall story and how it seems to be window dressing on the tactical combat experience. This was generally fine for me, and I was glad that it was perfectly possible to play encounters in a different order then the 'standard story line' in many cases (but not all). At the least, doing things out of order did not seem to break anything for me (such as being unable to finish important objectives - with one noteable exception below).  On the downside, though, I found that navigation was slow and at times extremely confusing (and thus quickly boring). I found myself repeatedly referring to walkthroughs and the like to figure out what the criptic instructions of NPCs was meant to tell me. It was also very common for important instructions to quickly scroll by to be missed, so I was not even sure what I was supposed to be doing. The worst was a large map midgame where it is possible to get very, very confused and commit immersion breaking mistakes, requiring a reload to an earlier save.  The other immensely annoying aspect of the game was the constant lock picking, alarm deactivating, trap removal. Those activities actually took up a huge chunk of each map to the point that, considering that the contents of chests were often literally junk, I ended up skipping over only to miss the occasional important item. Thus, this became an extremely tedious negative experience which greatly subtracted from the overall fun. Also, the question of whether a given container was trapped/locked/alarm protected did not seem to follow any kind of logic.  Also, let's face it, this genre and the game mechanics that go with it are really becomming outdated, and this game, while providing a somewhat modernized and, IMHO, polished execution of it, still does not make up for the fact that the mechanics are artificially held back to a kind of simulation of 1990s technology. This to me is the greatest cause for the lack of depth in character development and other such aspects pointed out by others. While 3D rendered, this *is* really a glorified isometric game in presentation, and I found the low resolution of the characters to be a bit confusing in that it is not as if someone is going to be playing this on an Android phone (or is it?) I think they could have upped the resolution of the characters by a bit, and for instance have more of them appear to reflect what they were wearing.  Edit: While I'm on the subject of graphics, I have to say that the base model used for player characters is *UGLY*. There is really only one head shape each for male/female, with a few different skins slapped on seemingly slightly off center, and I had a really hard time coming up with characters that came anywhere close to someting I could identify with (this is an RPG after all). This is not a big deal, so I mention this only as a minor complaint. The other thing I found to be *extremely* distracting was that the NPC portrait displayed on screen when conversing with that NPC invariably looked nothing like the 3D character, including clothing, colors, hairstyle, etc. This to me was just sloppy and incomplete. Rather than putting an emphasis on having portraits that would get lots of likes on Devient Art, they should have gone for volume and made sure that every unique NPC had a unique portrait. Judging by some of the really bad portraits available in the initial character creation screen, my guess is that they hired an expensive artist to do these portraits and ran out of money. That was definitely a design mistake.  Certainly the game is visually beautiful to look at (when zoomed out), but after having played the Fallout reboot series and other Bethesda RPGs, which provide a relatively modern immersive 3D first&amp;third person experience in a fully unscripted open world, it becomes increasingly difficult to be fully pulled in by this old-school, scripted, controlled viewport experience.  Not only that, but the freedom of the Bethesda approach has allowed very deep modibility which extends the playability of the games for many years, whereas this game ended up being just a minor distraction over a couple of weeks, sort of like a short TV miniseries.",1,0

I was met with a boring story that felt cliched but not fun cliche,, you're working with 1950-1960s you can have so much fun with a story like this, but non is to be had. 4/10.   for gameplay, what can I say it's ripped off ghost recon with less strategy and more overpowered abilities. once you get the team you like, you're never going back to anyone else. It plays like a third-person shooter with an ability to stop time and issue commands. it works just feels very bland. their is nothing new about the gameplay nothing extremely fun, the research is boring you find items in the field and you can now use them.. tada? the leveling system and skill trees are okay it's where you get the more enjoyable game mechanics, but after that it's a lot of boredom. 6/10.   the graphics are alright? I really found nothing out standing or incredibly bad. 5/10  the music is half bad, some is just bland and fades into the background with no significence while other parts are pretty good, we're not talking Doctor Who finale of a series good but pretty darn good. 6/10  Replayability? what replayability? 2/10  why haven't you mentioned X-com yet? ah well you see this is not Xcom, say it's Xcom but they removed too many core mecahnics of an Xcom game to feel like it is one.

555060,Final Soccer VR,"Finally I can fulfill my dream of being a professional net master!  The game starts with only simulation mode unlocked - you're faced with front kickers trying to score a net and once you grab their balls 5 times it unlocks arcade mode. Arcade mode fires balls from cannons and the cannons can turn into power ups - fling the balls back at these to enable Matrix style bullet time mode, tiny net mode, beach balls, giant hands, tennis balls or put 6 wall panels up that deflect one ball then break.   Story mode gives you 2 rooms full of arcade and simulated kickball modes with loads of challenges, such as 'save 5 balls against Japan' and 'catch 4 in a row and don't let your balls drop'.   Multiplayer mode gives you a code, like in Just Dance Now, which another person enters into the Android or Apple version of the game on their mobile - they kick the ball and you master the net to stop them.   To simulate a full size net place, the game accelerates your movement if your room is not massive - you can turn this down in increments or off completely if you enjoy breaking your face on furniture/walls. I would recommend making sure Steam VR is set up so the orientation has no physical walls to the left or right of you - it's better to punch your mate who is watching from the sofa than it is to break your controller on a wall.   One thing, from the video promoting the game, they obviously want women to play but there's no way to play as a woman (everyone refers to me as 'he').

338930,,"The STORY:  Like most transformers things (besides the animated movie), the story is garbage. It is just megatron trying to turn the planet into cybertron again. no biggie. You stop him and there is drama and a big ending finish. Not a selling part of the game. Honeslty, I watched the story on my first play through just because but I could have skipped it and been happy.  The CHARACTERS: You get to play as the transformers DUH! You get to be a dinosaur, a VW beetle, a Ferrari, a jet, a semi truck. I mean come on. One good thing that seperates this from the stupid ♥♥♥ movie transformers is that bumble bee is his old goofy self again. He is also literally the only transformer I like. If you like the transformers than that is great.  The GAMEPLAY: OK. THis is where ti shines. The gameplay is absolutely amazing. I have not played a game with gameplay this fast in a very long time. It is very refreshing knowing that people still make games like this. You play as a transformer, who through his actions must fight off the bad guys. I mean its not deeper than that, but that is all you need. The fighting, at times, is so fast, it is almost impossible for my brain to keep up. The dodging has to be spot on, the aiming has to be spot on. It is a game that actually takes skill to play. It is very fast paced and I have noticed that it overall made me a better video game player because of it. It has made my reflexes much faster. I would compare the fighting to hard mode on DDR. If you havent played that, then try it. The fighting needs your constant attention, if you look away for 1 second you are sure to die. This of course is on hard mode. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME BELOW HARD. I tried it on easy and it was waaaaaaay to easy. I had to reset after chapter 1. Here is an example of how hard it is. I beat chapter 1 in like 10 minutes on easy. It took me like 3 hours on hard. I beat the VERY first fight in the game where you just fight grunts on easy in no time at all. After setting it to hard, I died 4 times. I died probably over 30 times fighting the last battle of chapter 1. After the game I was like, 'cool. I just beat it on hard I am a cool guy'. Then it told me I unlocked 2 harder difficulties. Great! So hard mode is VERY hard but it is not unobtainable hard. These new modes I am sure will make me wish I was dead. In the hardest mode you die if you get hit even once. There is also TONS of unlockables. You get challenge mode which lets you play different challenges with different characters to unlock cool weapons and stuff. It is super fun. 50 challenges in all. It took me an hour just to do 4 on all difficulty modes. You get to keep your weapons and stuff to help you through the harder things. There is NO tutorial. You can upgrade your weapons and even make your own weapons and perks and even your characters level and stats, like strength, speed, courage, int, ect. It is very RPG based like that. Once again, there is no tutorial but you can figure it out. I had no idea you could upgrade stuff until the middle of the game. I figured it out after just messing around in the menu and I became a BEAST and I was one bad a## mofo ready to take on all the constructobots at the same time. You also get tons of weapons and perks. They are limitless all with different attributes and whatnot. It's crazy. If you wanted to level every character to max and get all the best weapons and beat everything on the hardest difficulties, it would literally take thousands of hours. I almost forgot, there are 2 space battles in the game. Almost made me J*ZZ.  The MUSIC: It is a ROCK and TECHNO mix. It is pretty cool actually.   The GRAPHICS: It is amazing. At times I wasnt sure whether I was watching an actual drawn video game or the cell shaded graphics. It is a throw back to G1 Transformers. It is very nastalgic and very exciting and fun. The graphics will do 60 fps at 1080. It makes for very fluid gameplay.   The CONS: (none really) So the main complaint about this game is that it is very short. This is true, if you only play it on the easiest difficulty. The first time I played it, it took me about 12 hours. That is just the main story. You have challenges and perks to get and all kinds of stuff. It will take you about 10-12 hours to beat on hard, but then you got 2 more difficulties to beat and 50 challenges. I don't even want to think about how long that is going to tae me, but I will have so much fun doing it.  The VERDICT: Amazing game. I waited for it to be 50% off because of all the bad reviews on steam. It is way worth the 50 dollars. I loved it so much I bought it for a friend, so I spent 50 bucks anyway. My only regret for this game is, I wish I would have bought it earlier when I wasn't in school so I could play it all day. I would have gladly paid 50 dollars for it. It has loads of content. Loads and loads. DO NOT LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVES. I am telling you, if you like brawlers and very fast hard gameplay, get this. It is super fun.   95/100",1,0

313010,Cities XXL,"As it stands this is basically unplayable. Performance is slightly improved from the previous version but there are some weird bugs now.  Over 9+ hours of play this is what I have found that I consider game breaking:  1. When you re-load a game the game forgets what ever trades you had set up. So as you may leave the game with a positive trade balance, you will now suddenly find yourself deeply in the hole. 2. The moment I hit more than 500K people living in the city my office start dying for no apparent reason. This has a knockon effect to all the other industries. Basically the only way around this is to 'import' office services, but that quickly eats up your exports (not to mention you cannot sell other stuff as they eat up your precious export slots). 3. Randomly areas go from 'happy with entertainment' to 'not enough entertainment' even if nothing else has changed.  As it stands, it's unplayable. I had it crash once on me as well, but considering how the game itself is broken that's not my biggest annoyance at this point.  If Steam would give refunds, I'd want one.",-1,0

24010,Train Simulator,"HOLIDAY EXPRESS STANDALONE GAME REVIEW -- NOT A REVIEW OF TRAIN SIM 2014  If you are an old-timer like me, this game will stir nostalgic memories and flights of fantasy involving that much anticipated electric train arriving in Santa's bag with shiney tracks glistening under the twinkling lights of a Christmas tree, the faint smell of ozone as the engine crackled to life, and the artificial smoke beginning to magically flow as the mighty engine began its journey of delight. The game is wonderful at any age where the heart is stirred by a love of trains and a desire to get on the floor and switch on the transformer to start an imaginary adventure. Nope, it isn't the usual serious rail sim fare. While it does use the Train Simulator 2014 UI and does have tools to edit your layout, the game is a more casual and relaxed experience.   You can earn some achievements, gain some experience points, and collect the trading cards in much the same way as the primary game. It may also spark an interest in more serious virtual railroading for those who find the game enjoyable.  At the steeply discounted price of $2.99 for Holiday Express through the rest of the month, it is hard to go wrong with a game that delivers such a fun experience. (Note: You do not need to own Train Simulator 2014 to play this standalone game.) And who knows, it might just be a good fit as a virtual stocking stuffer for your gaming friends.   My last experience with Train Simulator was with a much earlier version. I have to say this sure is improved and a lot more fun. I have a feeling that every once in awhile in the days before Christmas I'll be punching that left controller stick to hear the train horn/whistle and with childish glee guiding an engine around curves and up inclines just for the fun of it.  That said, it does have some rough edges that might make it a little tough for the youngest players. The on-screen directions will tell you to stop at a marker, which you can see in the 2D map, but which isn't visible in the 3D view. In the 2D view, you can't see your speed to know what you should be doing. The controls while easy to use with a controller could do with more granularity in managing speed and braking - the jumps with the slightest touch are fairly big. So mom or dad probably will need to be nearby to give a little bit of coaching on using the controls for young players just starting out.",1,0

356570,Party Hard,"This game was something I didn't think id be interested in, Being a big fan of hotline miami's fast paced action the thought of stopping to hide bodies didn't seem interesting to me but I picked the game up in the sales for cheap and im glad I decided to play it. It has a multitude of levels to play as well as some bonus levels and the workshop which lets you play other people's levels. With the base levels you get about 6 or so hours worth of playtime though each person might struggle with different levels, miami beach for example, I beat it on my third attempt in about 13 minutes but i've heard some people saying they were stuck on it for an hour and a half.  I had an issue with my PC which made me lose all my data on my hard drive and when I got back up and running I installed Party Hard to find that I had lost my progress ( I was finished the final stage and about to start the bonus stages.) But I kept all my unlocked characters so I got to experience the story a second time in about 2 days it was still fun.  There are unlockable character's, The guy trying to get some sleep, The cop, the ninja,   Katie   and the butcher, each character plays differently i.e. the cop can carry bodies without suspicion but can't use traps.   Not many games compel me to finish entirely and get all achievement's but this one was definitely good enough to make me do it, Toward the end of the game I already had a good 10 or so achievements out of the 26 I believe and that was with me only trying to get one (the 20 kills combo to unlock the butcher) the others came naturally though the game.   The soundtrack is pretty great though It did start to get a bit repetitive towards the end of missions considering it's a pretty small loop but it's not too bad.   I may start to try get all the cards so I can finish the badge next and i'll basically have done all I can with this game.  I would definitely recommend this game to any one who enjoys Hotline Miami or even Hitman and it's definitely worth the price though if you aren't sure if you'll get what you paid for then wait till the sales and buy it then but I guarantee it'll be worth it!",1,0

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"First thing's first, take the 'recommended' with a grain of salt. I would give it 3 out of 5 stars, but this stupid rating system is binary.  Okay, so a little while back I wrote a review out of saltiness for loosing too many games in a row, and I need to apologize for that. As my apology, I would like to submit this new review with more thought put into it and slightly lower sodium content as well.  So basically, this game is Call of Duty.  What? Is that not good enough for you? Fine, I'll go deeper.  All in all, the game is about what I would expect of Call of Duty, you run around various maps and shoot the enemies. That's all there really is to do in this case, because for some reason the only game mode anyone on PC plays is Team Deathmatch.  There's some new features, like any sequel, like paint jobs and weaponsmithing, but after I was reeled in by the game's supposed gun customization and black market, but I bought the thing and it went 'aha, I tricked you! Those features are laughable at best and I'm just another Call of Duty!' Basically all weaponsmithing did was show you what attatchments you could put on a gun, and it turned out to be no different form just applying attatchments and a camo to a gun the normal way, since you couldn't use your crafted gun until you unlocked it and all of the corresponding attatchments. The paint shop was interesting I guess, and you can make your guns have some pretty cool designs if you're willing to invest an hour or three, but half the time my designs won't even bother to show up in-game. There's also contracts that update daily and weekly, so there's always some kind of goal you can give yourself if reaching max prestiege and level 1000 (FREAKING LEVEL 1000!) isn't enough motivation for you. Once completing these contracts, you get tokens which you give to the black market merchant (which I say loosely because he's basically just some snarky jerk in a hoodie) and you get to open a futuristic treasure chest with a chance to get weapon camos, customization items for your soliders, and other types of astetic items, most of which you will never use because they're for a gun nobody ever uses and frequently get duplicates of. But you can also get melee weapons which are super cool, but the chance you'll actually get one is next to none unless you have so many tokens you either never stop playing or you spend your entire paycheck IRL buying them.  Speaking of the weapons, I feel like there's a clear distinction between guns that are good and guns that are bad. Back in Black Ops 2, you could use basically any gun and do well, but now there's a clear best sniper, best pistol, and so on. As for the actual gameplay, it's just the regular COD formula except you can wall run like in Titanfall, jump around like in Halo, and you can play as a selection of specialists with uniqe abilities and weapons like in Rainbow Six Seige. Boy, COD sure did rip off other games this time around. But you can swin underwater in some areas a bit and I think that's origional, but I never really used it because the controls get a little rebellious at that point. I never really got used to the whole movement part, but it is amusing to wall run once in a while, even though it usually gets me shot in the face.  Visually, I don't have a ton to complain aboout in BO3. The graphics are nice I guess, but it's a little hard to appreciate them when people are trying to murder you with automatic weapons and high-caliber rifles. Speaking of which, snipers somehow became wizards in this game. It seems like all they have to do is point the barrel of their gun in my general direction and the bullet would find it's way to my frontal lobe on its own. This led me to believe that sniping was really easy in this game, but it actually feels harder than it's ever been, leading me to wonder how the heck those people pulled it off. Until I watched a few killcams and saw they actually just put red dot sights on their sniper rifles, thus completely taking away any difficulty in aming the thing and defeating the purpose of it being a 'sniper' rifle.  However, the thing that sets it apart from all other CODs is that this fish has some personality. There are wild camos to be unlocked, ridiculous outfits and taunts for your characters, and no shortage of crazy melee weapons. They're rare if you don't spend every waking second grinding for those stupid tokens, but seeing your soldier dabbing to celebrate a victory on the podium is worth it in my book. And a quick word of advice, do give the melee weapons a shot. I know it seems stupid in a game about shooting things, but going melee only is probably the most fun I have in this game and I found that I usually led my team in kills by doing this. Aside from the combat knife and boxing gloves which the game just gives you, the melee weapons I had were the Nightbreaker, some kind of ancient weapon made of bone and flint that kind of looks like a prehistoric Halo energy sword, and a spooky dagger called 'Malice,' which I prefered to use. I would pair this with perks that protected me from enemy radar and one that silenced my every movement so I could sneak up on unsuspecting enemies, stabbing the filthy snipers as they tried to collect clips for their sick montages. I would also play the specialist whose special weapon was another melee blade, except you didn't need to switch to it and could just press a button to lock onto an enemy and dash forward to pierce their chest. I found that I prefered the 'up-close-and-personal' method of combat; I guess there's a part of me that is refreshed by being able to see the fear in my enemies' eyes as I take vengence on them with a presumably cursed dagger named after the thing I feel for most people I play against.  But all things considered, it was essentially just another Call of Duty. It introduced a few new features, but after a while it just all morphs together and feels sort of 'meh.' I'd recommend just getting the $15 multiplayer-only version of the game (if it still exists) and get a friend or two to play with you, otherwise you'll just end up like me: a lone, salty soldier whose only ambition is to take revenge on other players and open more futuristic treasure chests.",1,1

I have invested 812 hours of my time into Shogun 2 Total War which to this day I still love. My last few hundered hours I'd play with my buddy(s) and we would constantly talk about awaiting the release of Rome 2. How awesome Rome 2 will be. How we will conquere the ancient roman era.... Instead we constantly have desync issues.... We can't even manage to get through a fifth of our campaign.... before we have to trash it and attempt another. I am now at the point I don't even intend on attempting another coop campaign with anyone and actually look at just uninstalling the game all together. I love playing Total War Games.... Ever since Shogun 2.... I can't play a Total War campaign alone.... It isn't the same with out your buddy.... no matter how many minutes they take to go through with their turn.

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"TL;DR: Story overall good, but sometimes meh and confusing, villain disappointing, characters good, gameplay absolutely amazingly fantastic. Still a full recommendation due to the extreme degree of freedom you as a player have in this game.  Grandiose gameplay, astonishing freedom to approach situations, rarely a restriction that tells you 'you gotta be stealthy or else instant failure bro' (happens in 'total stealth' mode and the opening mission). Being a sneaky Snake fails? Well, just roll with it and shoot soldiers in the face. You can still complete the mission, it just might not be an S-rank anymore and be a little harder as well. The buddies are a great help - Quiet is universally helpful, the dog is the ultimate stealth companion sniffing out any enemies within 60-80m and D-Horse can get vehicles to spin out if it takes a dump on the road. Never even touched the D-Walker mecha you get later on, probably very useful for a louder approach.  The story/characters will be confusing if you haven't at least read up on the story of previous Metal Gear games. It also could use a bit more focus, espeially in the second chapter where you mostly replay old missions with added difficulties (meh!). A few story threads could have been tied up better (chapter three was axed, after all). The cassette tapes that you can listen to greatly expand the lore of the game and easily span a few hours of material.  Oh and I really was ashamed when I found out why Quiet was left half-naked by the developers. Ashamed for them. I might have bought that reasoning if she had been treated well by the game's camera, but she's reduced to eye candy and fanservice for drooling teens and pre-teens who don't have internet access way too often.  Online invasion mode is something I could really do without. Not that well implemented, often not that well balanced and riddled with connectivity issues.  Another bugbear are the development times and dispatch mission times. Weapon/Gadget development is instant at first, but later requires up to two and a half hours of time in which the game needs to be running and not paused. At least 15 of my 130+ hours were spent AFK or on the desktop, allowing development to happen while I didn't want to actively play.",1,0

251870,Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~,"Even from the preview I saw, I knew I would love this game, and was extremely excited for it (which I haven't been THAT excited for a game in a long time). Bascially, if you want to know some stuff about Japan, and want to be taught about it by some cute girls that you can forge a relationship with, then this is right up your alley!  You play the role of a guy who's trying to learn Japanese, so he decided to go to Japan to be mentored by two brothers he met in an internet chat room. But, lo-&amp;-behold, these two guys were actually sisters! You get to pick 3 of 6 places to take tours around before your time in Japan is up. Now, if you wanted to just learn about Japan, this is awesome enough as it is. BUT. Depending on which places you choose to tour, you develop a relationship with one of the two girls! TOO MUCH AWESOME. Not to mention, the endings are simply adorable. If you're someone like me who enjoys cute and innocent romances like 'Ai Yori Aoshi' or 'Clannad,' I can just about guarantee you'll fall in love with this game! ...And one of the two girls! ;D  The soundtrack is amazing (I would have the game on in the background just to listen to the tunes), the visuals are great, and if you're actually trying to learn Japanese, it's great because in the dialogue, you can view the Japanese right above the English! The info they give you is fantastic, and the romance storylines are really nice!  All in all, I highly recommend this game! I sure had a blast playing it, and now I kind of want to learn Japanese so I can play through it while reading the top text. Not only that, I also have the goal of going to Japan in real-life to get firsthand experience. This game is a great way to get introduced to a new culture, and I surely hope they expand on this game in the future! Maybe a sequel or add-ons...? I hope so!",1,0

Luck needs to be on your side so that you won’t run into performance issues, with a good tolerance for repetitive content and, preferably, some friends to play multiplayer with also being required. And even then, there’s still the issue of the AI that turns the game into a snooze fest very easily. Space Hulk: Deathwing’s biggest redeeming factor lies in its visuals which provide a faithful representation of the Warhammer 40k universe that is bound to please fans. Take a few steps further than that, however, and you’re bound to run into disappointment.  Full Review  [www.noobfeed.com] .",-1,0

113020,Monaco,"Monaco is a difficult game to describe because it doesn't fall into a well-tread genre, but it's part puzzle game, part top-down action game, and overall a lot of fun. Up to four players form a team of criminals attempting a heist, and the game is a race to collect all of the money and treasure without getting caught by the gaurds. It's heavily designed around online multiplayer, and the open lobby system makes it easy to get matched up with random partners in crime.  One of the best things about the game is how it handles difficulty and varying player skill. Aside from levels that get progressively harder as the storyline unfolds, success in each mission is less about getting through the mission at all and more about doing it as quickly and effeciently as possible. So if you end up with a mix of veteran players and n00bs, everyone can still do their own thing and feel like they are contributing even if some players are doing more of the work. The time/speedrun system works well for replayability, because once you become better at the game it's a lot of fun to use your new skills to plow through some of the earlier levels.  There are eight different characters in the game all with different abilities, and the balance between characters is pretty good so that there are not obvious best and worst characters. Also each level has different aspects that can make certain characters more advantageous, although it's always possible to complete the levels with any set characters. There's also an entertaining and somewhat convoluted storyline for the game that gives each character a unique personality.  The core gameplay and level design are both top notch and that's why the game makes you want to keep playing levels to try for better times. I would recommend it to anyone who likes action-y games, especially if you are looking for an online co-op game. Even for people who don't generally like online multiplayer games it can be a good intro into that kind of game because you can start out as a novice and not feel like you're in way over your head. Great game and I look forward to more games from Pocketwatch.",1,0

It's probably the lightest rogue-lite I've ever played, complete with - fairly plentiful - opportunities to save at no penalty (if there's an unlockable difficulty with no saves, play that, though it really  should  have been unlocked from the start if it does exist, and included if it doesn't) - but it's still challenging enough, and the procedurally generated worlds are surprisingly satisfying to carve your way through.

The two biggest flaws in the game are around sound and combat. I don't like music in the games and sound effects/ voice acting were not there. It was like playing a game with no sound at all. Combat was a little too dumbed down for me. Would have liked more depth.  There is slight customization of the main character, but no open world elements that would drive you to want to replay it. Story line is designed to be linear with only slight variation in how you can solve problems. Combat v puzzle.  I see this geared more to a younger audience. Others might tire of the repetition after the first two areas.  I recommended the game, not because I loved it, but because it delivers on what it is.",1,0

298900,Space Hulk: Deathwing,"Okay, so we all know this game has some issues, so let's start there.  Cons: -Constant crashes in multiplayer -Multiplayer not connecting at all -A meh at best single player experince -Weird tyranid spawns -Poor optimization -Vermintide-esque horde splatterhouse &lt;-- (enjoyable game btw)  Now let's talk about the good stuff.  Pros: -Absolutely stunning and immersive Warhammer 40K environment -Decent singleplayer AI (for the terminators) -Sometimes surprising Tyranid AI(i.e. flanking, ambushes, etc) -Fun multiplayer experience (when it works) -Nice voice acting (I want some combat dialogue damnit)  This game is new, and they have been working on it for a while, but I think it can become an excellent Space Hulk game. The base is definitely there and we have never seen a Warhammer environment so passionately designed before. It needs patching, like any newly released game. It needs optimizing, it needs some fuggin Terminator combat dialogue. But it's a good start. There are times I really feel like I'm in a Space Hulk and there are times when I know they're showing off beautiful level design. The AI needs some work, and these phasing Tyranids are most likely a performance thing, but my god if that motion detector wasn't there you'd eat tyranid scheiße way sooner.

451840,Out of Ammo,Fun but shallow with minimal options for base building or units. Drop in multiplayer is sweet. Great workout as every unit needs to crouch to be behind cover and gunplay feels good. Friendly AI will not use grenades and must be thown by you. Later waves are impossible single player as AI cannot be told to prioritize suicide or RPG enemies. Wait for a sale unless more depth is added.,1,0
317470,Cubic Castles,"I'm writing this to address all the short-play reviews that are giving downvotes that the game doesn't deserve.  If you're looking for a free, easy game to zone out on while you listen to other things, then this is the one for you. It's light weight, cute, and has very simple mechanics that are transferable from other games, so if you've played any platformer, you should be able to master this game quickly.  A lot of people whine that you have to pay money for 'cubics' (the in-game currency) to buy anything useful, but that's completely untrue. Virtually every block can be found in-game or crafted from blocks found in-game. The only things really worth spending your cubics on would be more personal realms (beyond the initial free one given to each player), extra rooms for your realms, or cosmetic items. Blocks found in-game CAN be purchased with cubics by the extra lazy, but it's so easy to find the blocks you want that there's no reason to.  In the first day of play (about 5 hours of zone-out time), I managed to get over 1,000 cubics and level up several times, unlocking 'perks' which allowed me to craft more advanced blocks, tools, and toys. Once I had these things unlocked, I was able to get more ambitious with my building projects making a castle that rests on narrow outcroppings of rock above a lake of lava. It was easy and fun to make and made my personal realm a hang out spot for the friends I made in-game.  My greatest complaint for Cubic Castles, without a doubt, has to be the extremely shoddy camera control. Nowhere in the tutorial does it explain how to control your camera and for the first day or so, I assumed there was a fixed camera. While there are benefits for having an overhead view of your character and landscape, I think the game would benefit greatly from a first-person or third-person view. In its current state, navigating below-ground or under any sort of structure can get in the way of the camera and obstruct your view entirely.  Another feature that is lack-luster is the PvP combat system which revolves entirely around 'wands' that can only be crafted by experienced players and are not very intuitive in actual combat resulting in a high chance of missing. Also, there's completely no penalty for dying or benefit from killing another player.   Overall, though, I have to recommend the game because it IS entertaining and it's so light that even weak rigs can run it at the same time as another video or livestream or even another game.",1,0

350080,Wolfenstein: The Old Blood ," While  The New Order  was mostly sci-fi,  The Old Blood  slips downright into the occult.

316010,Magic Duels,"Always online functionality - check! Servers don't work - check Lots of outdated filler cards - check UI and graphics from 2001 - check  Let's ship that game!   Blizzard must be laughing their a**es off.   Edit March 2016:  Still cannot recommend the game.  While the server difficulties are solved, the game is still lacking in many ways.  There are annoying card bugs that have been there since the launch. Stainless stay true to themselves and don't bother fixing even the most annoying bugs. (They have done the same in all their past Magic games, for example they have not and will never fix some glaring bugs in 2012 and 2013 editions, one of which makes a whole (paid DLC!) deck unplayable, others make some cards useless. So there is no reason to think this will improve.)  The card selection is overall better now, but the game is still dominated by only about 3-4 standard decks. Add this to the very slow gameplay with very long timers and it makes for boring and frustrating play. There are of course still a lot of useless filler cards, but overall it's doable to unlock all cards with reasonable effort, but this gets harder and harder for new players, so I'm not sure how the playerbase is supposed to grow. Ranking mode is pretty useless, the levels don't really reflect your skill as there is no ELO system.  No chat, no lobbies, no 3 or 4 player, no archenemy.  Simply not fun in this state.  I hope Wizard pulls the plug on this one and lets a better studio have a go.",-1,1

230230,Divinity: Original Sin (Classic),"So, I just finished this bememoth of a CRPG. And I find myself in a bit of a pickle. Usually when I finish a game, if I've stuck with it for its duration, I feel very strongly one way or another as to whether or not it was good.  I don't feel that way this time.  So then, how do I review a title that both provided some of the most enjoyable RPG action I've played in years, but that also occasionally threw up a baffling design decision that detracted greatly from the overall experience?  The answer, I think, is that I recommend the game, but warn you lovely people.  Divinity: Original Sin wants you to like it. That's immediately evident. The first third of the game is a constant stream of reworked CRPG tropes, a strange mishmash of the familiar, and you know what? That works. That works extremely well. It fuses Fallout and Baldur's Gate into something honestly beautiful. It's funny, it's clever, the plot's central mystery unfolds with a refreshing lack of cynicism and delicacy that's all too devoid from most modern games, it looks great, it runs smoothly, and most importantly, the combat is an absolute treat. Learning to use elements to manage enemy lines and unleash ridiculous combo attacks is one of the best things I've done in a game this year.  But Divinity starts to fail you. It creeps up slowly. Around the 40-50 hour mark, you start to notice that very little has actually been happening. The game spirals to a satisfying enough conclusion, but the sense of adventure and refreshing take on the old-school is slowly lost.  And then Divinity decides to flip players the proverbial bird and introduce loads of forced stealth sections, the most egregious of which found me actually holding my finger to the quicksave key.  Some would argue this is part of the experience. I'd counter that things change for a reason. I didn't play CRPGs in the 90s because I wanted a quicksaving simulator, I played to have an adventure. Divinity offers 30 hours of a truly classic CRPG, and 40 of a middling one.  This is enough for me. The genre has been sorely devoid of great new games for a long time. But, I reiterate, this is a recommendation with an attached clause: don't expect a gamechanger. Don't expect to not have to fight Divinity on its own terms. This is a CRPG, with the warts you've forgotten about securely in place.",1,0

391260,Labyronia RPG,"I like the look of RPG Maker games and this game used it well. I enjoyed the use of the many terrains.  I did not like the main character, Arres. He was suffering from memory loss, sense of self, and random behaviors so it was hard to get to know him. So much about him felt like a mismatch.   The story felt somewhat typical with the twist being the labyrinths. I did not like the labyrinths most the time. They were tedious and frequently I was at a loss on what to do or where to go.   The turn-based battles, when they weren't over the top random, were enjoyable. We never got to see the enemies hit points and as a strategist I would have liked to see those but now I'm just whining.

You get half the content of most modern games with DLC that is (so far) absolute garbage. First time i've seen something this bad from Square Enix.  3. Micro transactions like crazy. Since the story mode is so extremely short, people gravitate to the other modes. However those modes are written to get you to buy micro transactions. Pure cash grab garbage content with little play value. 4. Multiple play throughs don't expand story. Its just the same rehashed run. 5. Optimization is garbage.

Some people may not see this as that big of a problem, but on my laptop where the arrow keys are very small, it becomes an enormous barrier. So much frustration could be cured if movement could be transfered to wasd rather than the arrow keys. It is hard to enjoy the game when pretty simple parts end up killing you because of constant misclicks due to the unchangeable controls.  Otherwise the game is okay, but honestly not that great.

449800,Attack on Titan / A.O.T. Wings of Freedom,"I ran the game on two of my machines one with a laptop with i7 6700hq 16gb gtx960m max @ fixed 30fps and my desktop i7 3820 16gb gtx1070 max @ fixed 60fps both ran pretty rock solid once I got things working.   So for the hiccups, firstly I found that my laptop did not detect the game and kept it on low power mode for some reason so i had to force my laptop to run it in performance mode via Nvidia 3D settings. Of course this was only a problem for my laptop.   Second it didnt read 1080p initially in windowed mode, when i set it to fullscreen it became available. It also does not give you the option to utilize higher resolutions than that either.   Third the game does not have a built in v-sync at all, i had to force v-sync using the Nvidia 3D settings to avoid the tearing, luckily it didnt affect framerates or latency in any noticable way.   Fourth on initial startup for both machines I was prompted to set the game on windows 7 compatibility mode for better performance. The game then kinda just switches it for you after accepting it, it was really odd to me.   and Fifth the game is horribly optimized for keyboard and mouse, this is a game you absolutely need a gamepad to play.  once you get past that stuff the game itself isnt too bad, the controls are a bit unorthodox but its something you can really get used to within the first 10-20 minutes of gameplay. You really wouldnt think this was made by koei since all they ever do is make 3d hack and slash games.  so far for me it seems to work fine though, the comments though seem pretty unjustified in most instances. The game has its problems though if you have the tolerance to the problems.",1,0

243120,,"Too bad there is no neutral option, so I had to choose to recommend it.  This is a weird one. The game definitely got flaws, a lot of them. It's not very well fleshed out in general, to be honest. But it is very, very compelling where it's at its strongest.  Betrayer is noticeably repetitive and doesn't have many engaging mechanics, and the ending is considered puzzling, cliffhanger or even lackluster by many. But its creepy, atmospheric setting, striking presentation(which you can fine-tune to your liking!) and brilliant sound design more than make up for its flaws. All exposition is provided via text, however, and there is little environmental storytelling. It tries to be an semi-open-world RPG, but to be honest it's much closer to a fetch-quest driven FPS with RPG elements.  It's an atmosperic, immersive story of how flawed humans are. Overall, this game is kinda closer to its artsy-fartsy kin, rather than to mechanichally competent products. In my opinion, it's well worth the asking price, and if you're into this kind of janky creepiness - go ahead and try it.",1,0

310950,Street Fighter V,"Short version:  -This game is a great fighting game -Has online problems on launch most likely due to having 2 platforms on the same server alongside just needing time to adapt to the issues concerning the netcode. -All dlc is free. -They said it'd be barebones on launch. -If you're a casual/looking for a single player experience, wait until more features get added in the coming month or so to buy this. -Try using software like xpadder if you're having issues with your stick/controller.  -If you're serious about getting good at this game, buy it now.    To everyone complaining about the lack of content currently in the game, we were all warned a suitable amount of time before release that there'd be little content outside of multiplayer on release. Most people should be aware of that by now, so it's not really a valid arguement at this point. As much as people want to call Capcom out on the lack of features, they didn't actually do anything morally wrong this time lol. DLC is free too, you'll be able to earn it all, so any complaints about these two subjects are basically invalid.   As an actual fighting game, this is solid, the gameplay is fresh, combos cater to the newer players enough and there's still a lot of depth to it; it pleases older and newer fans just fine in my opinion. Alongside having an already diverse cast more characters are actually on the way, Alex is set for release next march. Alongside this, a bunch of other features and extras will be added as time goes on like an actual arcade and story mode alongside the market. The tutorial mode that's available at least teaches you some basics, the rest is kind of for you to figure out really. That's part of the fun of these games anyway, it is sort of poorly done in this case, but it's nothing you can't find out for yourself by asking around/doing research. You'd have to do research at some point anyway if you plan on taking this game half-seriously, so there is that too.   Online mode has been relatively OK for me so far. I used a wired connection, so maybe that's why but I've had hardly any issues with lag. The one time I've lost a match because of it was against some guy in Canada, which isn't too bad given that IV had netcode that made it even more difficult to play with people this far away most of the time. Aside from this one incident I've won all my matches pretty cleanly with hardly any contribution from lag. I also feel like people need to understand that on launch, any online-based game is going to have problems. There's hardly ever been a massively online game that had no online issues right out of the box, because most servers aren't able to handle it well initially. SF has a massive fanbase and it was crossplay too, that means players from two different platforms are going to be on the same server, which sort of justifies how poorly it's been handling the load so far. They'll improve it with time, that much can be certain at this point.   I'm guessing it's because of maintenace but I haven't been able to find a match recently after waiting a while, so I can't really say much as far as actually finding a match. I did however struggle earlier for a while trying to make a lounge with a friend for much longer than it should have taken, which was pretty bad. We did actually get it to work eventually and our matches were pretty smooth. It seems like there's a lot of difficulty finding matches because of what's probably a server-related issue.   About the controller issues, it's not impossible to play with your controllers, you'll just have to use something like xpadder. I use xinput so it hasn't really affected me though.  ",1,1

The framerate in this game is locked at what seems to be 10 FPS. It's hard to tolerate. I've never seen anything this bad. Maybe this game was made in Basic.  Extremely difficult to control your character:  There's a setting to toggle run/walk but that stopped working after about 5 minutes and no longer works so I'm stuck walking. Seriously. I reload an old game save and that one is stuck running.  360 pad works, but only the analog stick, not the D-Pad. This is really dumb since movement is not analog.There is an option to 'hold down a button to run' (It's the shoulder button), but it should be the OPPOSITE! Hold the button to walk! And as mentioned, this might not work after a bit. The shoulder button is a bit too clumsy for this dextrous task as well. Very unfortunate.

325610,Total War: ATTILA,"Attila is very likely to Barbarian Invasion an expansion of an original game, fielding a lot of advantageous updates**.  The difference between both are the price. While BI for Rome 1 was sold as an expansion, Attila is sold as an stand alone expansion quite full priced. Granted you can buy it for about 24 € outside Steam - and legal too - at a lower price Attila is worth it and works out. What does not work out is the optimization.   Attila is more demanding than Rome 2, but offers also better graphics, including MSAA, and more detailed units. While vanilla it looks like it is modded but it is not.   Attila is Rome 2 2.5, without a year of patches. It is much better and whole, but still not worth a 8/10 that was given by the most of the reviewers.  Rome 2 was about civilized scam, Attila is about barbarian scum. Armchair generals will love it. Also the multiplayer works much better and fluid.   I can recommend a buy but not full priced. Look for legal alternatives instead and be prepared you have to lower the graphical settings even on high end computers.    CA officially explained that 'extreme quality' is meant to be played on yet non-existent hardware. Yet 2 settings below that you still can find yourself embarrassed with low framerates.   This all has a high price though: People with AMD processors (not graphics cards) will suffer a lot as they did in Rome 2, on quality settings or below Attila becomes barely playable. I am currently collecting results in the TWcenter benchmark thread.   Warning: 7 DLCs are already reported on SteamDB.info, so get yourself ready for a DLC fest!  +4 many 'new' features that people wanted to have in Rome 2 +1 better music but still repetitive +3 much better graphics, vanilla it looks like modded! +2 multiplayer has been improved a lot: Stability, slightly overhauled chat and lot less lag, and most important no slow motion units so far  -2 on the flipside very high requirements, that are either very GPU limited even on HIGH-END computers (maximum quality preset or extreme preset and even quality preset) OR CPU limited on lower settings like performance and high performance -1 still severe lack of optimization for AMD CPUs, which now kills the game at all for people that have AMD processors. - to high priced as it contains a lot of features that were (intentionally) missing in Rome 2, 7 DLC listed and hidden zero day!

307780,Mortal Kombat X,"I have read a few reviews on the store page so i thought, even though i have still invested just a couple of hours into the game, I'd write a few lines to point other potential buyers in (what it think is) the right direction.  When you go for Mortal Kombat you really already know what to expect. The game mechanics are tried and tested and there is really no way for you not to have fun.   Want fast paced fights? Check! Want ninjas, monsters, necromancers, shaolin monks and whatnot? Step right over here! Want Fatalites? We gotcha!  Developers brought a few new ideas into the mix this time though, first the brought back brutalities which are simply finishing moves much like fatalities only triggered by combos. Second, they decided to make every character unique by differentiating it with three combat styles that gives the character access to a particular moveset. It might seem like a stupid thing, but having access to a specific set of inputs really changes the whole game. Take Scorpion for example: The ninjutsu style gives him pretty much the same moveset as MK9. A second style instead, gives him access to his two swords that make it easier for him to launch enemies into the air and start juggle combos.  Besides this the game also has multiple modes to keep you entertained. If you want offline play you can meddle with the story mode or try out single matches, the kript, the towers.. really a lot of things to keep you busy here. Online mode is no less, you have faction war (you basically choose a faction and every win in the online mode adds point to you team) with particular events like invasions.   The true weak point of the game is poor optimization. Besides the large game size and the huge patches, the game keeps on running sluggishly. I understand that I am playing this on a portable PC but i'm quite sure the game can definitely run on medium settings at least. Instead i'm stuck on running it with all Visual effects off and at minimum resolution (800x600) just to enjoy it properly. Even with this configuration though, the game has some hiccups at times.  As for DLC's i don't really see the point in whining. One may consider these to be a major or minor weak point, but i just don't care. If you think DLC's are not worthy of your money, the only thing you have to do is not buy them. They don't really cut off any extra parts of the story but just add a handful of fighters... I don't really see what the fuss is all about.  In the end, I think the game itself is worth the price, given that there are interesting ideas and the gameplay is fun. I can see how the optimization will throw off a lot of people but i think it'll get sorted over time.  ",1,0
203810,Dear Esther,"Beautifully crafted audio and visuals tell a paced and thought provoking story. Accepting that there is not really any actual interaction with the environment (the player is an observer and is not able to manipulate the environment in any way), is manditory in order to step into the narrative.

34010,Alpha Protocol,"Controls are clunky and painful, protagonist has an absurdly annoying voice that you will immediately be sick of, when the player walks around while crouching it's one of the most comical animations I've ever seen, and the shooting mechanics suuuuuck.  But it's still one of my favorite games, becaaauuse... 1. It balances player choice with a smooth narrative. No matter what direction you choose, the story always compensates and fills in the gaps with finesse. 2. The skills actually reward you by giving you crappy skills to begin with. You start out as a top operative but can't shoot worth a damn, and then after several missions and a few upgrades, you're finally getting the hang of things and notice a dramatic improvement in the mechanics. 3. The supporting characters dynamically react to how you treat them. This is the closest we will get to scripted AI dialogue where our responses affect the NPC's attitudes and behaviors in conversations and remain consistent throughout the game unless you resolve the conflicts. 4. Gun modifications make sense and follow a semblance of realism, which isn't unpopular nowadays but adds a nice addition to the game.  This is a super toned down version of Just Cause with fantastically crafted dialogue. And right now it's 3 bucks. You have no reason to not buy this game.",1,1

Use your Blink-spell to get higher up the building and use your crossbow to take out your target. Want to massacre everyone? Just kick in the door and start shooting with your gun, slash with your sword and summon plague-rats to eat your enemies. Don't worry about being shot! Just slow down time and dodge the bullet, after that, just slowly aim your gun on the head of the enemy, shoot and resume time again. You can even finish the game by not even getting noticed and also by not killing anyone! It's all possible!  Remember, every method takes it's time and it's skills. Decide which strategy you like best.  Rating: 8/10 It has some flaws, but it's almost invisible while playing! With the DLC's released you can even listen to the other side of the story.

401360,The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human,"From the haunting melodies by Karl Flodin, to the wonderous seascapes of post-apocalyptic Earth,  The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human  is an audiovisual treat. I'm not much of an art-critic, but to me, this is a game that feels...significant. I'm overcome with this feeling of inspiration. At any moment, I could sit down at my desk, turn on the PC, and write something really powerful. Anyone who read it would also become inspired, and the cycle would continue until the entire world became just a little bit grander.  Well, maybe I'll do that tomorrow. For now, let's focus on the game itself. Some of the first videogames I ever reviewed originated in the arcades, so I tend to pay more attention to basic qualities like controls and design. My approach to reviewing this game is to strip away all of the extraneous elements. The visuals are lovely, and the soundtrack is excellent, but right now I'm tuning all of that out. All I see are lines, dots, and rectangles. If I open my ears enough, I'm sure I'll hear some bleeps and bloops. With this scenario in mind, do I still consider  The Aquatic * a good game? Yes!  Aside from light exploration elements, this is a game that revolves entirely around boss-fights. As a  Darius  fan, I've always been a sucker for oceanic-themed adversaries. While that series operates under the basic trappings of a 2D shooter,  The Aquatic  goes in another direction. Each of the 12 bosses are approached differently. Aside from each boss having a unique look, they also have their own patterns, weaknesses, attacks, and environment. Not only do you have to pay attention to the projectiles the boss might fire, but also your immediate area, and the following action the boss is liable to take.  This is not a game to approach lightly. You're going to die, possibly a large number of times. In my view, all of these deaths will be fair. The sub, even at its default speed, is fast enough to avoid every attack, it's just a matter of understanding movement. Yes, it will seem slow at first, but there will be cases where you can avoid attacks entirely with a little fore-thought. The first boss (a giant worm) has an attack where it spits several smaller worms at the player. The player can attempt to hang back and dodge every single worm, or they can work their way around the giant one. By doing this, the player avoids the entire attack, and gets a nice opportunity to do a lot of damage to the boss. Unless you're after a specific achievement, the sub can also take quite a bit of damage through the acquisition of hull and auto-repair upgrades.  The most important weapon you'll have for the boss-fights is your harpoon. In order to get the most out of this tool, you have to grasp the basics of risk vs reward. The harpoon can be charged to hit distant targets, or the button can be mashed repeatedly if an enemy is close. Naturally, the closer you get to the boss, the more dangerous they become, but they can be destroyed more quickly. As you develop strategies to defeat these bosses quickly, you'll discover the real depth found in this game. It's almost entirely boss-fights, but it does them justice.   Since the game delivers in terms of the more important qualities, I feel more comfortable talking about its artistic side. Videogames that take place in or around large bodies of water have always intrigued me. When most other games have the obligatory water stage, I can't stand them. I think it's because nobody really appreciates the ocean, they just want to have some harebrained swimming mechanics, in order to pad things out. Videogames that embrace the ocean and the life that inhabits it, such as the  Ecco the Dolphin  series, are just incredible.  The Aquatic  really captures those immersive moments, where you're blown away by all that's happening around you. The world's surface (and humanity) is long dead, but the seas are as lively as ever. The minor visual details like the remnants of human architecture and various types of marine life bring everything together.   The soundtrack can not be praised enough. This is a short game, so it's welcome to have a unique track for every part of it. I've always said that good music can elevate any game, and this is as appropriate an example as any. The boss themes in particular are superb. You're the last human in existence, fighting off an abomination, for reasons you can't quite grasp. The music in these tense and disturbing situations really preys upon the game's sense of hopelessness.   While  The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human  isn't lacking in quality art and sound, it also holds up well purely as a videogame. There is some entertainment in poking around a small yet visually dense world for upgrades and other secrets. However, most of the fun and challenge is in learning, defeating, and then mastering the myriad of bosses. Overall, this is a unique experience that's definitely worth checking out.  *Sorry, but I can not write out that title every time.

359320,Elite Dangerous,"I'm not even sure where to start. The developers of this game are a group of idiots for one. They had originally started development on elite dangerous, under the promise that there would be no dlc's and no p2w micro transactions. Instead of doing dlcs at the time, they decided that they would purposely stop support on the first release of the game to continue with another release called (Elite Dangerous: Horizon). This was a standalone game that mirrored Elite Dangerous in every aspect, but added a few more features. When the community confronted them, they stated, 'In order to keep our product going, and keep our promise, every big update will be a new game'. Are you kidding? The community outraged (except a select few drones, willing to kiss the @ss of the devs). The devs were going to make a new game, with every update, on an EARLY ACCESS game. It was the dumbest idea, any developer has ever tried. Due to the community uproar, Frontier decided (finally) that it was an absolutely terrible idea, and started releasing DLCs. The game now, is no longer in Early Access, and it's going to be a dlc fest (if they even continue development). Go to #1 for links to facts.  Now that the standalone has become a dlc, they decided to label it a season pass, and in case you were wondering, it’s not. (Not sure if this will be fixed, due to community uproar). The “Season Pass” isn’t labeled as such, to signify it allowing you more than just that one dlc. It was labeled that way, due to more dlc’s with the label “Season Pass” in the header, getting bought, than those without it. They won’t be giving you any more DLCs if you buy it, no future content. Their excuse for using it, was “It’s a season pass because we plan on giving you the updates of the dlc for free”. Really? They were thinking about charging people money for the bug fixes to their crap dlc. That’s just BS. Go to #2 for links to facts.    Last and not least, the newest of all, removing support for 2% - 10% (the devs stated it would only be 2%, however, due to all the lies I’m sure they are continuing with their already FoS practices) of their player base. 32 bit, and direct x 10 support is being removed, after people with those specs have already bought the game, can’t get a refund and now, they won’t be allowed to play it. That’s their way of kicking their fans in the face, for pointing out their business flaws, and threats to boycott the game, due to its greedy and incompetent devs.  (You can see their refund policy below, even if they lied to their players, they won’t refund the game if that’s why you bought it, luckily, steam allows you to do so with a few guidelines, but it’s better than frontiers flat no, #3) Before you ask, I’m running AMD FX-9370 4.7 – 5.2 GHZ, 2 GTX 970’s , and 32gb of 1600/2400 ram. I’m not using DX 10 on any game that allows for 11, and it’s a 64bit system. I just find it to be a horrible thing to do to players, remove them after paying for it, with no chance of refunding.

Much like Minecraft and many new survival games now available, we are encouraged to find our own goals to work towards. Building projects, expansion, amassing resources...you name it. The same applies here, but primarily this game will successfully run itself after a while and I find it dissatisfying to simply collect a ton of resources only to lose them because I built a new 4x4 farm.

355980,Dungeon Warfare,"A great tower defense game with a huge variety of towers, enemies and possible strategies.  This is a hidden gem of a very good tower defense game, comparable with Defender's Quest and Gemcraft, but ten times less known. What can you expect from the game?  - A huge variety of upgradable towers, unlocked gradually so you can learn about each one - Respeccable skill points that you can (and must) distribute according to the map you're going to play - Challenge modes that make the maps more difficult in exchange for better rewards - An endless mode with ever harder waves  - User-created maps and a map editor  Most of the fun comes from the well designed towers and traps. In their most basic form, TD games have usually three types of towers - the reliable peashooter, the slow firing group damager and a slowing tower. In Dungeon Warfare you can of course use these basic towers and combine them with traps such as: - Spikes shooting from the ground - A harpoon pulling an enemy towards the abyss - A push trap that pushes whole groups in the direction you wish - A blackhole that sucks nearby enemies onto a single tile, making them a better target for the following AoE attacks - A lich that turns any enemy it kills into a zombie fighting on your side - A rotating spintrap rising from the ground and hacking everyone who comes near into minced meat - A hex trap that turns an enemy into a frog  There are many effective combinations you can find and there is no set way of finishing a level. For example so far my go-to killzone consists of a chessboard of spintraps and spikes with a blackhole at the beginning and a spring trap at the end. The spintraps and spikes deal most of the damage to groups, blackhole pulls enemies periodically back so they have to travel through the kill zone again and the spring trap throws any straggler back into the fray. Sprinkle with a few liches to further slow down enemies and a gold enhancer and put a grinder at the end for any heavy units that make it through.  Another favourite strategy that some maps support is a using lot of push plates and harpoons combined with a slow trap, disposing of enemies by pushing/pulling them into the abyss. This is especially useful for large groups of slow, heavy enemies. It doesn't however work on thieves and horsemen who are too fast for the push plates and run through. Those must be disposed with a spintrap/flamethrower or spikes. The abyss also doesn't pose danger to flying enemies, those are better killed with a lightning trap and bolts.  All enemies have their weight and pushing/pulling traps have their force, so light enemies will get pushed further/faster than heavy ones, something you have to take into account. You can upgrade your push traps to have more force, but if there is a walkway behind the abyss, light enemies might get pushed too far and land safely on the other side, while if the trap is too weak, heavy knights and golems don't even move. Of course this can also be used to your advantage, as you can create endless cycles forcing groups of light enemies to go through your killzone multiple times...  You get the idea.  Graphically the game looks very simple, but unfortunately the screenshots don't make the game any favor as they look very chaotic. When in motion the game is quite clear and you know what is happening.  Don't let the screenshots dissuade you.  All in all Dungeon Warfare is a very good entry in the TD genre, well worth playing.",1,0

241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor: Road Warrior: Judgement Day: The Hunt for the Red October is kind of cool I guess.  You play as Troy Baker pretending to be Talion, a Ranger of Gondor who lives on the Black Gate of Mordor with his wife and son where absolutely nothing can go wrong.  Oh no, everything went wrong!   The Black Gate is attacked by, surprise surprise, the forces of Sauron and Trayvon and his family are murdered, then the game ends. Okay no, I'm just yanking your chain. It turns out that Talion and his family were sacrificed to bring back a wraith to the waking world. A wraith that was probably enjoying it's nap before some jerk who looks like my heroin dealer killed a few shmucks to try and... I don't know, catch him in a bottle or something.   The wraith, having been reading JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and playing Persona games on his down time, thought it would be super cool to roleplay as his favorite Stand by possessing one of the dead people and refusing them the embrace of death. And so begins the journey of Troyion and Spookyface as they exact their revenge on the orcs of Mordor.  But these aren't your typical orcs, no sir. These are the Senior year High School Rugby Team equivalent of orcs. Uruks are supposed to be larger, angrier, and all around ruder than their rank and file counterparts, though you probably wouldn't be able to tell considering how easily Tony tears them to pieces. And since the average Uruk goes down the same way I go down for 20 dollars whenever Terry is in their view, it's kind of hard to imagine that these guys will someday lead Sauron's black army through the gates of Mordor.   Well that's where the big thing that was advertised comes into play. Basically the game randomly generates some named officer Uruk's that serve as mini-bosses for Terrance to fight, such as Otrek the brain-damaged or Twerky the Goblin. Each one of these mooks has a set power level and abilities that make them differ from your average Uruk, they also have this novelty where they remember who Tron 2.0 is and what he did to them if they manage to survive an encounter with him. Though the novelty wears off after a few hours, especially later on when you're bottle necked into fighting them a certain way considering they have more abilities the higher their power level is (Or at least that's what I figured.).   Okay now I'm going to say some bad things about this game.   As overplayed as J.R.R. Tolkien's works are in modern times, Middle-earth itself is a very magical place (No, not that kind of magic, stupid, the other kind). Through the books, yes I can read, the movies, and even other video games, Middle-earth always felt like a real place, with it's own history and people and cultures. It's a place that, even with all it's dangers, you would want to explore and visit, see it's people and locations.   That magic just isn't there for Shadow of Mordor. I know it's based in the one place in Middle-earth that looks like my bathroom, and it's supposed to be much more grim than it's counter parts, but it almost feels like a cop out, like it cheated and just slapped on the Middle-earth name for brand recognition. It doesn't feel like a game set in Middle-earth, it's far too isolated and lonely for me to care about the settings and characters of the story.   I can't say much about the combat, I mean, it worked for me in the Batman games, and the saving grace for it here is just how vicious Talion uses his weapons on his enemies. It's like somebody killed his family or something.   But should you play Central-hearth: House of Trogdor?   I say get it on the cheap. If you can ignore all of it's story and play it like some sort of heavy metal inspired fan fiction, then you'll probably get a few hyucks out of it. I would like to see the nemesis system make it's return in another game, though, it seems cool enough for people to do neat things with it.

378830,The Princess' Heart," At first glance, The Princess' Heart isn't your textbook RosePortal product. The pre-made Enterbrain RTP visuals and mapping seems lazy. But is it? Is the game just a quick cash grab or is there more to it than a simple premade asset layer?   At first, when I saw the promotional screenshots for the game, I was appalled. Not only by what I saw as below average mapping (at least by RosePortal's usual high standards, compared to many other RPGs out there it doesn't stand out that much) but also horribly small characters that had barely anything redeemable to them. And the battle system - goodbye side-view custom battles, here we go, pre-made 'first person' combat with sprites not really animated at all.  And yet, I gave this game a chance and played it through. In full.  And I don't regret one single minute.  Why? Like I said, graphics-wise the game is very much below RosePortal's usual average. It's not all that about the RTP tileset: the resource can be used to create beautiful environments that would be very much on par with Whisper of a Rose's (it just didn't happen here, instead we have a bunch of square-looking mazes), it's more about the characters, both the playable and NPC ones as well as the monsters. RosePortal made it a habit to have each monster fully animated in combat, here we have a simulation of movement by close-up effects or stretching and un-stretching the enemy pictures. The character sprites are RPG Maker VX Ace's defaults, meaning they occupy one tile (that provides little room for them to look good) instead of RosePortal's regular, whooping three. While the environments are varied, some of them just don't look authentic. Instead of posting a series of trees or a large unpenetrable layer of bushes/trees as the level 'wall', RosePortal applied the one tile that I think shouldn't be used: a tree trunk on a black background... that looks grotesque when seen on the corners as the blackness between the trees would have been understandable in the middle but not at the corner. A few of the maps seem empty and barely decorated/filled with content, I'm mainly looking at the Old Dayaz desert area and Maplefield. The only actual custom graphics I've noticed are: the title screen and the intro movie, which both are really well done.  However, I'm bringing up what I said before: I don't regret one single minute spent on playing this game, not one bit. And that is because, quite frankly, The Princess' Heart delivers much more in terms of other departments than in terms of just visuals.  Let's start with the music. It's, again, downright beautiful. RosePortal have once again delivered an alluring, orchestral-sounding set of musical pieces which all fit quite well into the game's environments and narrative. I can't say it more clearly: buy the Deluxe version, just for the soundtrack alone, the music being already in the game files be damned. They deserve support just for the quality of that soundtrack alone. My absolute favorites are Dark Heavens (the demon boss combat theme) and The Beyond, named after one of the game's areas. Epicness absolutely ensues. Not a single RTP track was used in the making of this game, a stark contrast with the visual layer.  As far as the gameplay goes, this is your standard jRPG fare with a wee little twist. Just a little. There is no crafting option nor there are any weapons to be picked up (so that option is useless), instead like in Sweet Lily Dreams, the only thing we can equip our characters with are accessories. The combat system is simplistic but works - albeit it does have two new options. First, some spells have an area of effect - so a single-target spell may actually hit some neighbouring targets if you choose the right victim. That can actually save you a lot of MP which would normally be used for all-enemy-targeting spells. Second, you can swap characters in the active party not only outside of battles but also in-between turns! This can get you out of sticky situations - if some characters get knocked out and you have no means to bring them back, simply replace them with others, fully healed and just waiting to kick the monsters' butts. I happened to use this feature just once, on the final boss, but it sure counts: when it was almost dead and I knew my current party doesn't have what it takes to kill it in one volley nor will they survive its next attack, I just replaced them and in three further turns, the battle was over. I was the one left standing.  About the battles: they aren't a chore but they can be a challenge. Areas can technically be completed outside the beaten track as besides the final three dungeons, you can reach pretty much every location quite early on in the game. Enemies do NOT respawn in-between level sections most of the time, so you have to leave to the World Map - this may be a lifesaver if you're particularly wasted after just narrowly beating That One Boss. They do however have quite a level of difficulty, also due to the scarcity of items. There isn't an abundance: there's just what you get from the chests plus what you'll buy in the shops but with one catch: the prices rise alongside your overall character level so you won't be able to afford 999 of those Elixirs or Magic Waters. Most of the time, you need to make do with what you have found from chests. Money isn't earned by just winning the battle either, nor is it rewarded by the completion of a quest - you need to sell what you've acquired from battles in order to make some money.  About quests... well, there's just eleven of them, so not that all much, but then again a game advertised as 15-hour is less than a half of what you'd spend on Whisper of a Rose, so that number would kind of fit. What irks me is their overall lack of variety. Half of the sidequests involve you bringing the questgiver a bunch of high-quality drops from the monsters. The others do make much more sense but there's more than one occasion of the trope 'Guide Dang It' being invoked. And it's a bad trope to invoke. I mean particularly the Cambolton Fortress quest involving the king's soul. Honestly, given what the Counselor was saying, one would think that the first place one should visit is the desert city Daragit. Uh... suffice it to say that it's a waste of time. The solution is right there in Cambolton, it's just so non-intuitive and so hard to spot that I literally needed a guide to complete it and I wasn't the only one, judging from the forums. A couple quests end in a really anti-climatic way, such as the Arsonist one (why didn't I get the option to deal with the guilty party?!) or the Emily exorcism one (props for the 'Exorcism of Emily Rose' reference by the way) - why wasn't I able to actually WHACK the possessing demon instead of just having it expelled like someone snapped a finger and said 'begone'? Yep, the sidequests definitely lack polish. The only reward you'll ever get for them is Journey Points which are used to learn skills. And again, there's a glaring issue: at some point (as a little grinding  is  recommended to progress smoothly and you also get JPs after gaining character levels) there's simply TOO MUCH of these points to spend'em.  ----- review continued under 'Comments' as it was too long - apologies!",1,0

203510,Fortune Summoners: Secret of the Elemental Stone,"I have renamed this game to 'Kawaii Souls'. The art work is cute and the character designs are cute. The game story is fairly well made, other than the fact that it takes every opportunity to force you to explore a hardcore dungeon. I was kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at the 'hot springs arc', the part where the party of adventurous magical school girls goes to an Onsen for a field trip and I was so keen on seeing the artworks for that but...  I had to explore 2 dungeons before getting to the Onsen and guess what happens when I get to the Onsen? ****SPOILERS**** The Onsen is dry... ****SPOILERS END**** Now here we go to explore a few more dungeons. I stopped playing for quite a while after that.  It may sound easy to you, 'pfffft... a few school girls clearing dungeons, it'll just be one of those easy Japanese made weeaboo games.' Well, you are wrong, for the most part. There is a reason why I chose to call this game 'Kawaii Souls'. Because it's hard as ♥♥♥♥, therefore I hereby make a Dark Souls reference. I play on normal and the monsters are so hard to kill, oh my god, I sometimes contemplate killing myself. But it's a good point, to some, the combat AI is amazing. I feel like the AI learns the way you fight, and calculate strategies on how to break the way you fight. Normally there would be a sequence that each mob follow in combat situations in other games, and you just have to figure out that sequence and you'd get through the game easy. But it's the complete opposite in this game, if you don't constantly improve and change the way you fight, the AI would kill you off, easy.  Other than the amazing...ly hard combat, the dialogue and story is quite good too. The humourous and cute (omg the babbling Sana, so cute, kya kya) dialogues always cheer me up after spending hours trying to clear a dungeon. But sometimes I wonder what's actually keeping me here playing this game...  Overall, 8/10 game with over 20 hours gameplay. Would play again.",1,0

Suddenly, the creepy, distant monster that pops up occasionally was actually attacking me! The game lulled me into a false sense of security and then yanked that security away. The noises that came out of me were created by sheer panic.  I've played a wide variety of horror games and this is definitely worth giving a shot!",1,1

The first game will seem pretty bland if you've played anything newer. But I liked this era the most and Altair is my favorite.  I'd say pick it up on a deal if you're iffy about something a little aged with some repeated aspects throughout the whole game. 20 is kinda steep.

Don't get me wrong, the textures, lighting, character design, voices, buildings, weapons and world are OK, maybe 10 years ago I'd be really impressed with this game. However it just doesn't cut it after Skyrim, it's not even better then Oblivion or Gothic 2. To me, it's just not 'open world' unless you can jump and look around the back of the cave for a few elusive coins.  Shame, because it looks like a nice world and it's obviously had a lot of thought put into it but the gameplay too generic, paint by numbers and boring.

409690,Pink Heaven,"Ahhhh if you read my last review for Pink Hour you know how excited I was to play this one. And well.... it did deliver once again and put a smile on my face the whole time through!. The events take place after Pink Hour where you are warped into what seems a lab as you talk to your 'boss', then you are sent to heaven where the main game takes place. I really won't say much else as the game is short so it would be pretty much spoilers but I will say this one has 2 levels and a umbrella upgrade which was a nice touch (the umbrella would let you hover after you jump letting you skip from place to place). All in all this was another joyride of happiness and I still highly suggest you play both of the games! I hope KeroBlaster is just as good. (oh and it's confirmed that the main character is a girl potato.)  Pros:  - 2 levels   - Still has hardmode after you finish the main game, which means replay value  - Free   - Controlling miss potato feels solid for the most part!  - Funny and cute story.  Cons:   Even though there really isn't cons to the game I will just list a couple things that felt weird while playing.  - I didn't address this during the first game's review, but when you start shooting you are stuck into that position. So if you are shooting straight you are stuck to shooting straight and can't shoot anywhere else unless you stop completely and aim in the other direction and start shooting agian. It doesn't bug me much but it can for sure get a little annoying.  - Even though the umbrella was a pretty nice touch it didn't really seem useful for most of the second level except a few parts, and for just the story itself. Also sometimes if you jump from block to block to fast you will most likely trigger the umbrella which can as well get a little annoying.  Really nothing game breaking just a couple things to talk about since the game doesn't really have any cons lol   Thank you to the team who created this little fun game and I hope you keep making them !",1,1

24240,PAYDAY: The Heist,"Game is fun but too many problems.  Game breaking problems.    1) Hard game difficulty not from legit reason but many cheap ways.   None can really play this solo owing to the specials that will always get players, with near 90% accuracy.   It is left 4 dead that zombies shoot gun (with the most lethal rate I experienced in FPS game) and specials  come far more frequent than any this types of game.  It is only frustrating.    Warhammer vermintide, which I recently played, difficulty is also legendary but specials aren't this cheap.  At least they give god damn 1.0 seconds to react!   2) Too stupid AI  It is yet the worst AI for team mate I ever experienced and will be the worst AI exist.  Because anyone with any sense will not put this kind of AI if there is some more better  technology to put it.   Basically, for any maps with difficulty higher than normal, AI players will never get you up if you are downed.  But as owing to above 1) reason, you will get down at some point unless you played this game 200 hours owing to  some unknown reason (there are less than 10 maps, come on you have better things to do than this),  than playing with AI will fail for cheap reason.     3) Difficult to meet any legit players  Owing to above 2) reason, it is wise (in fact, playing with AI is barely optional) to play with players,   but some of them are even more stupid than AI (I bet my ♥♥♥♥ing crayfish plays better than them)  and huge game breaking connection problem (someone is joining than need to wait ♥♥♥♥ing 10 minutes).   I swear I met 2 legit players for my last all playthrough with sense but all other players get down within 2 minutes  after joining and going out.      For those reasons it is horribly done game.   Many developers think making game somehow broken (like current killing floor 2 which has basically nearly   nothing to do with killing floor 1 but only with some similar mechanisms but horribly done) and   try to fill it with some other ridiculaous mechanisms and saying game is damn challenging.   It is not challenging. It is god damn cheap and limited contents means there is no worth playing this game   to the level of mastery what so ever.     The only saving point of this game is uniqueness of the game to rob various things, which is quite well done but  completely ruined in payday 2, which I played for 800 hours, now completely broken by DLC and update  that player is more durable not wearing armor, paper cut cops that has 0.0001% shoot accuracy compared to  payday 1 cop that has literally the most accurate enemy in entire (I dear say entire, I played FPS game for   god damn 25 years and they are the most accurate, their accuracy is even way better than most of players).

Occasionally you meet one of several different types of enemies, each requiring a different strategy to get past, be it hiding in a closet, sneaking past or just running away. Once you figure out how they're easy to avoid. Most rooms are just empty though. The backgrounds look nice and detailed but only very rarely is there something you can actually interact with, and usually it just means a close up view of the object. Every now and then a loud noise will try to startle you, together with spooky or disturbing imagery. It tries to scare you, but personally I was never scared or even startled.  Like this it continues for the 1-2 hours it takes to beat, and to be honest it's way too long for how little of interest actually happens. By the end my thumb was tired from having to constantly hold right on the left thumb-stick. That's what you'll be doing 90% of the time, just walking to the right.  There is a vague story. A girl died and haunts your dreams. The game drip feeds you some bits and pices of the story throughout the game but mostly leaves you with no story developement until your reach the very end of the game where you might find out what really happened, or not, based on a couple of branching paths in the game. Fortunately there is a 'nightmare select' menu so you can go back to these branches and choose a different path if you wish.  Bottom line, it's a game with a nice art style, good sountrack and atmosphere. But it fails in the gameplay and story department. It might be worth getting at a discout but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.",-1,0
394360,Hearts of Iron IV,"Hearts of Iron 4 is an excellent strategy game. It does a good job of providing meaningful decisions in all aspects of the country (diplomacy, industry, research, military, etc.) without overwhelming you with options like its predecessor. The epidemic micromanagement has been replaced with useful tools such as the division templates. Army composition is important, so having the ability to quickly update entire forces is quite nice. Air combat and naval combat are also much more manageable now, with sea and air zones broken out into fairly large regions where you can assign missions to hundreds of ships and planes at a time to cover an area. (Fleets can be assigned to multiple regions, planes cannot, although they do seem to roam a bit outside of the region if they have the range and nothing to do inside.) Air superiority feels right in this game and has a strong effect and leaving your troops exposed to enemy close air support will almost always result in a loss. Supply makes much more sense than before and makes it so that the infrastructure damage to an area will slow down large armies quite a bit and weaken them significantly. Ports are often very important for getting supplies in and out of areas making naval superiority important as well. The damage caused to infrastructure by bombing can also be quite useful to stop the enemy's supply and destroying the factories keeping them equipped. Everything in this game just works together so well and feels like it has a purpose and that your actions actually change things without being too difficult to understand what is going on. I think this may be the best Paradox strategy yet, and definitely the one with the strongest and most complete gameplay at launch.",1,0

Overall It is great, suitable for anyone who wants try RPG genre. One of the best entry point for modern RPG inspired by its classic  Regret for what I done. Why? I should have bought the ultimate edition from other store and knowing the fact Steam has locked my region, I have become disappointed.

I loved season 1 and was very scared for how season 2 would be, but Telltale came through with just as amazing of a game as season 1 and i could not be happier.   Combat and graphics and exactly the same as the first, but the UI is a little better and some extra combat mechanics that make the game more interactive.

250320,The Wolf Among Us,"The Wolf Among Us is an amazing experience. The game contains just the right amount of drama and mystery to keep you entertained, as well as throwing in some action scenes where appropriate. The characters drag you in, and in some cases make you care deeply about what happens to them.   While the game is based on Fairy Tales, it's not at all like the 'For Kids' disney version, nor quite like the gritty, dark reboots, It's very clean, and although the characters are recognisable from their respective fairy tales, they feel like entirely new characters.  The only gripe I had with The Wolf Among Us (along with all Telltale games) is the fact that, no matter what you do, the game has a definite story; and it is going to tell it whether you like it or not. Your choices don't really matter in the grand scheme of things, with many dialogue options leading into the exact same replies, and the choices which do lead down different paths, have no major impact on the story at all.  That being said though, I still feel like this game is one of the best games I've played for years, I could not put it down, and found myself going back to repeat scenes just to see what would happen if I'd chosen differently.

I was going to buy the add-ons but since Steam are doing this whole collection pack for the same price of the Teeth Of Naros DLC on PSN I thought I'd go for it and I'm glad I did, even though I still remember the plot, Amalur is a great place to revisit especially since I've got two new maps, an increased level cap and some weapon/armour upgrades all in the mix.

With the very open communication from the developers, I'm thinking any gameplay changes/improvements/fixes that the majority of players want/agree with will most likely be implemented eventually.  I find it fun to play, with a pleasing art style despite the relatively 'lower end' graphics.  Yes, they had problems at launch with heavy lag. But that seems solved now and you can read in detail about what happened from the developer point of view. It's a good read imo, never seen such open honesty from a developer I find it refreshing...being honest about mistakes vs covering them up with marketting hype trash takes courage. Courage that I, for one, very much appreciate.  Helpful community vs some of those games that seem to have nothing but griefers and trolls. If you do want to troll though, well they do have a playable troll race for you so there ya go :). You could be a troll hacker with a shotgun. Just don't try to troll or hack or shotgun me ok?

47810,Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition,"I could not reccomend this game more! From the wide range of options you get when making decisions or just talking to anyone, to the unimaginably hilarious background chat provided by your companions conversing to fill in the silence. Every character is given a complex story and personality; never have I been so emotionally attatched to virtual characters. Every piece of music for any occasion is a masterpiece, be it for a heated battle or during your escapades with your companions. This game is expertly crafted so almost every major- and, in some cases, not so major- decision you make will eventually come back to bite you in the behind, fully immersing you in the dark, dangerous, fantastic world you are free to explore in. This game has touched my heart in so many ways, and even with the short amount of time I've had with this game I can see how much of my time it will consume- something I don't regret at all. If you have the option, I'd highly reccomend that you spring for the Ultimate Edition. It gives you so much more time in the glorious world of Ferelden as well as out of it. The game is absolutely, categorically one of the best RPGs of all time. It is always worth buying and playing, no matter what year you're playing it in.",1,0

16730,Legendary,"6/10 GOOD GAME BUT EASILY FORGETTABLE   Legendary was released in 2008 during a time where the FPS genre was ran by the likes of call of duty,bioshock.halo,fear,red faction and games of the like so naturally the gameplay isnt too far off from those. it lacks variety and depth both in story and gameplay but on the flip side the visuals and  frame rate are pretty amazing for their time. the game had clunky irresponisve controls which didnt  make a big difference alot of the time but there were times (like during the minotar and griffin fights) were snappier controls would have been helpful but werent there so movements and actions had  to be pre planned and not done on the fly. overall this game is definitly worth a playthough with a few  things in mind: - dont take it too seriously  - dont try and compare it to modern games - put it on easy,kick your feet up and enjoy the  games nice visuals and loose story.",1,0

You can steal cars, upgrade them and make them your own, but when you gain the super power of super speed super early in the game, and run far faster than any vehicle, there is really no point in spending money on your cars anymore.

289130,ENDLESS™ Legend,"Great….  Rating: 9/10 - Gameplay: 10 - The same feel as civilization in managing cities and researching - Multiplayer: NA - Campaign: 8 - Strong storyline driven single player - Learning Curve/Depth: 10 - Same as Civilization, you can pick it up easily but there is depth - Community: 8 - Right out of the gate folks are wanting to play games, strong following - Performance: 10 - Runs so well on a regular computer  Been following this game for several months and found it was just as satisfying as I thought it might be once I got it downloaded and running. Quickly to jump into a game I found that the interfaces were very similar to civilization with a twist. The research and troop trees are a tad different but in a fun way. A lot of fun will come out of this game.  Last note: Do you like Civilization but hate the new space version as much as I do, this your game then! This is the game they should have made.

449540,There's Poop In My Soup,"Gaming industry is finally showing some signs of life after years of stagnation. After being fed $50 boring titles by major studios we finally get something fresh and funny. This project is really unusual and so for we may talk revolution, like when Valve decided to move boundaries with Portal, or when Blizzard finished Diablo... So far I don't remember video game being so bold when pushing new ideas. Visually game looks really great, the city is not the mose detailed in history, but good enough. What is a really astounding is how engine handles the large number of NPC on the screen. Animation is smooth and realistic. Thanks to the soundtrack game is even more atmospheric and deep. This game is the most fun you can have for less than $1 In short - if you think you need $5000 system to enjoy pc gaming today - check out this game - you will be pleasently surprised...

The bad points for me is that there is no variety in the music (or maybe it is hidden?), the more fare you progress more annoying sounds pop-in (so the game loose a little of the initial ambientation)  The game, for me, is not really worthy $4, maybe $1 as maximum, but that is just my opinion.",1,0

205100,Dishonored,"This is a pretty great game, with no real complaints to think about after completing it, other than the initial controls was weird having left-mouse do right-hand, and right-mouse do the left-hand attacks. I ended up swapping them, and things worked out. But thats purly YMMV material and has no basis on the game itself.  Gameplay is fluid, and interesting. Various ways to get through a level if you are not a completionist. Otherwise you just end up exploring every corner anyhow, and the various paths are exposed regardless. You can kill or subdue enemies in many ways. Althought theres some really fun ways to kill people, if you want to go for the 'good' ending, you need to curb your rampant desires.  The level design felt a lot like Half-Life 2, a mix of old with metal paneling and high tech gadgetry and even the Tallboys looked like the walkers (just two legs instead of three). But hay, I cannot give them fault for it, the game was meant to be steampunk!  Overall, very well worth the effort and play. I will re-play this one for sure for the other ending.",1,0

287450,Rise of Nations: Extended Edition,"Age Of Empires and Civilization had a baby. It's everything you could wish for in both franchises, tired of how aoeII has you going only through the medieval eras? Annoyed with waiting another turn in civ when you could just tell that f*cking worker to come here?  RoN is the logical extension of that, it goes beyond the tried and true modalities of standard rts fare and achieves something hardly any other rts or for that matter game has tried.   With the tech tree removed, the player doesn't have to wonder what logical pathways the authors followed when they had you go from wheel to the binocular to the atom bomb. What you've got here is streamlined: Pop cap bothering you? Military upgrade. Wanna expand? Civics. Commerce cap? Economy. Production too low? Science of course!  And then you advance to the next age.  Which does look substantially different. The architecture, the playstyle (in part), the units all look like they're really from the future compared to the loincloth wearing barbarians you started with.  There are races, and they do get bonuses, which feel more like personalized cheat codes. What else would you call instant worker spawn (china), extra city expansion (zulus), 3 free horse archers per stable (mongols), 2 extra max farms (egyptians), no borders (some indian tribe), double capital (persians) etc.?  WIth so many nations it's not hard to find one to suit your playstyle depending on what you feel in the morning.  Little caveat: The game is ideological, the two types of government have a clear bias, one 'libertarian' (democracy/republic/capitalism) against one 'authoritarian' (despotism/monarchy/socialism). But it's not as visibly overbearing as what civlization does, where the difference between being LITERALLY FASCIST NAZI HITLER and a snarky liberal late night talk show host is wether you pick assembly line or the scientific method.  What's more like age of empires is the warfare, it's the good old rock paper scissor we all love to hate: cavalry beats archer, archer beats infantry, infantry crushed beneath the treads of a tank, tank is nuked by the science civilization.  The difference between one age and nother is evident, especially in gameplay, if you don't catch up you're dead behind.  Castles and towers and barracks and siege workshops all work exactly like they did in aoe2, with the thing above as well as expanding and contracting borders.  Especially with the HD re-release, everythign is polished and overpolished, with one click you can get into multiplayer or stream on twitch or start a mod up.",1,1

It would be much easier and more convenient as well as cheaper to buy a deck of cards and to find a friend tht would abide by the rules. The concept of the game isn't very original since it was based off of a simple concept almost everyone who has ever played blackjack most likely has thought of before. Even with all this, it's not a terrible game, but i wouldn't recommend it rather just buy a deck of cards.  Final Ruling: Not recommended unless you can't find any friends or family or are too lazy to leave the house like me. On a side note, both are reasons why I played this game instead of buying some cards.",-1,1

The second one is the so-called 'GTA Rip-Offs', them being Sleeping Dogs and Saints Row 1-2. I will be comparing this to Saints Row 3 at the end, because this is Saints Row 3's 'Stupid, but fun' done right. So: welcome to Panau, an island filled with stupid accents, explosions and Rico Rodriguez. Now the gameplay is something like this: Rico is Zeus, if lightning was explosions, now Rico likes explosions, so he makes things explode. A lot. The game is basically the best action movie you'll ever play, and it is so fun that you won't even mind the horrible voice acting. At the end of the day it's 100% careless fun.

Buy the Gage Mod Courier DLC.  Want superior stealth capabilities? Buy the Clover DLC.  In order for me to perform as well as my teammates who have been playing the game for a while, I have to buy DLC after DLC.  And you know, even after you have all the DLCs to make you the most optimal player you can be, they'll release more DLCs with superior weaponery, weapon mods, perk decks, etc...  If the DLCs were made up of side-grades and/or cosmetic items, new characters, etc.. I don't see anything wrong with that.

However, as others, I have to point out that the remastering could have been done better, from a technical viewpoint.

307690,Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition,"9.5/10  This game has some moments that I thought were strange: QTEs, karaoke, and physics (but complaining about physics in a game with outrageous kung fu seems petty). The good game mechanics outweighed the bad quite heavily. The one or two parts I didnt enjoy I was willing to play through to get back to the game I was enjoying. Dont buy GTA. Get this or Saints Row. Wei is a badass on Jet Li or Jackie Chan scale and not a punk with a cousin tagging along to go bowling.  If you think you need the DLC or definitive edition you are probably fine without it. Basically is new enemies/fighting style and a little bit of story.",1,0
22200,Zeno Clash,"Unquestionably the best first-person melee combat in any game I've played in my life. What Mirror's Edge did for running and jumping Zeno Clash does for punching people in the face. Instead of the usual fixed camera and gimpy limbs, everything is properly weighted and moves naturally, so when you grab someone by the shoulders and give them a knee to the sternum, for once it truly feels right. The bizarre and surreal style, setting and design of everything only makes it that much better. Beating people up has never felt so right.",1,0

Brittany in the west is a Protectorate of mine.  - Late december 1808: As i continue to build up troops at Gibraltar, for an inevitable invasion of the Spanish mainland (as these hooligans have tried to take Gibraltar from me on several occasions these past few years!), i begin peacefull talks with Portugal, i give them new technologies for their Navy and get them to break their allegance to the Kingdom of Spain! 'huzzah!' i say, you people know what is good for you! Then i try to make them my ally.... they don't even have to join the war against Spain from me...they can become a protectorate of mine...or not... i promise them trade, revenue, offer them silly amounts of money... they won't budge... i leave them to make up their minds and will check in again in a month or 2...  -Early january 1809: Austria looses control over the Bavarian province because of Bavarian revolutionaries... i step in, crushing the revolution with the full might of my northern continental military force... Bavarian bradwurst is now part of the English breakfast...  -Early february 1809: Due to having to clear up the mess those lederhose wearing revolutionaries made in the north, i've taken my eye of the 'Portugese matter' for 'just a second' and what do you know? Those fools have the audacity to a attack one of my trade convoys sinking two of my Indiamen class trade ships and subsequently declaring war on me...  -Late february 1809: I am MASSIVELY annoyed at Portugal now.... i send the Fleet at Gibraltar out to take care of the issue, adding insult to injury, i capture all of their vessels and add them to my own fleet.  -Early march 1809: I've decided to make an example out of Portugal, and send two full armies to the capital of Lisbon. I show no mercy and leave no Portugese soldier standing during the Battle of Lisbon that ensues... Having emerged victoriously from the savage battle, i'm still mightely annoyed and instead of peacefully occupying, i randsack, pilage, ♥♥♥♥ and wreck everything on my path... wich brings me much loot ! ... loot that apperently now will be much needed to fix the place up lol  -Late march 1809: The souvereign nation of Portugal ceases to excist...  -Late April 1809: Maybe i went abit overboard, taking ages to fix the place up :s  meanwhile Portugese revolutionaries have sprouted up making all sorts of racket in the town of Evora...  -Early May 1809: I crush the uprising by killing off the remainder of what men of fighting age are left in the Lisbon province... Now that there are no men left capable of fighting in Portugal, they ALL love me...  10/10 Would annex Portugal and decimate the male portion of the population again...",1,0
241540,State of Decay,"Nice survival game. The gameplay reminds me on Walking Dead ( the series). You have to manage your base and crew, whats quite fun. I like the combat system which is more realistic than in other zombie games. The missions get after some time very repetitive, so you are playing some similar missions a few times. But the variety of the missions is the only negative point i have to mention here because the rest is done pretty good. If u like zombie and survival games State of Decay will be the right game for you.",1,0

343100,Overture,"A twin-stick shooter with (mostly uninteresting) RPG-elements. Initially very satisfying and overwhelming, the veneer of big numbers and particle effects wears off a few hours in. The movement and attacking is well-done, and it's a genuinely challenging and usually fair game.   The coolest part is unlocking and trying out all the different classes (24! wow!) which generally do play slightly differently. Once I did that, I tried to focus on beating the game. A few dozen deaths in, I came to realize that the only way to really have a chance at winning is to grind, grind, grind on each of the giant floors with thousands of monsters to click on. Levels are king, and the most correct way to play is also the most boring. This is unfortunate.   A floor time limit, diminishing returns on experience per kill per floor, etc would go a long way to making this less of a slog, and more of the 'pick up and play coffee break roguelike' that it wants to be.  I recommend this game all the same, because it is a lot of fun and I maintain that there's potential here, if the developers are still interested in it. I see they do still add content every now and then.",1,1

The birds were chirping their merry songs and I saw the neighbors exchanging friendly conversation. I turned on my computer and got online. My friend, Kyle, messaged me. We got caught up on our lives. He mentioned a new game that he found. A unique one based on the popular How to Train your Dragon Series. Feeling adventurous, we both downloaded it and began to play. Immediately, a smilie appeared on my face. I couldn't help. I just new from the very beginning that this game was something truly magically. The music perfectly set the mood. I began to feel like a viking myself. When I began creating my character, the amount of choices overwhelmed me. I created a character that fit my persona and felt truly connected. Then cutscenes introed the game and oh god the cutscenes. So masterfully crafted you would think they got them straight out a movie. When I finally began playing, everything fit in place. It was perfect. The controls were simple and fun. The interface was easy and clear. Voice acting was top notch. I think they got the actual movie actors! Everything was fun. Please, do yourself a favor and play this game.  1/10 IGN- Game of the Year",-1,0

It has a ton of references to pop culture that always managed to get a smile out of me and had great character development (at least for the girl i chose). The story is interesting and hours will dissappear without you knowing where they went. Unlike most visual novels, there are a plethora of choices as well as implications for said choices which is quite refreshing.  TLDR; Caught this game on a sale but after playing i would recommend even if it wasn't on sale! 9/10   UPDATE: Ending left a sour taste in my mouth.

13240,Unreal Tournament: Game of the Year Edition,"Having been an avid fan of FPS since Doom, Quake and then the deathmatch games Quake III arena and this since I was practically 9yrs old - even to this day as an adult this game is by far most enjoyable even in par with the latest fps releases. I still remember the era when online multiplayer gaming with likes of Quake arena and UT lead gaming forward and it was a massive hype. This game is a 10/10 especially rating as a retrogamer too.  No UT game compares to this one, not even the latest UT3 of 2008 and its disappointing to say that with every new game there doesnt seem to be much originality in the way of weapons, firing modes, environments unless its user generated even then not much. UT'99 beats even the latest releases. just repetition of old weapon designs and levels with very few innovations, which is probably what disappointed devoted fans overtime.  Overall, the pros and cons;  PROS: enjoyable replayable experience, a wide range of unlockable levels and gaming styles (Eg. Team deathmatch, single deatchmatch, CTF etc), quite fast paced and refreshing.  CONS: Doesn't run well with newer systems since Win7 or newer. Win 8 and Win 10 users beware that you might suffer from fps lag and glitches unless you chaneg some of the preferrences settings. Eg. I suffered a lot of fps lag while gaming for first time on my new win 8 system, and it was as slow as a snail until I changed the desired framerate in the video settings from 40 upto 100. ALSO to note that the default resolution doesnt help improve visual gameplay experience unless you switch it to 1024x780 or something.  But overall - HIGHLY recommendable.",1,0

If you want SUPERIOR graphics then buy STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT.....LOL you  would NEED a 350 dollar video card to run STB along with the 60 dollars for the game itself.  Buy this game when it is on sale with most of the DLC being included. It's cheap..it's fun and you can play up to 6 players in co-op mode......SO much fun to decapitate a foe with a fire axe.....and the slo-mo kills are right out of Max Payne.......enjoy,1,0

22200,Zeno Clash,"Here's a game you should definitely try! It's both great and well... incredibly average, but it's satisfying from start to finish. This is a short game, you can easily complete it in about 3 hours. It's a kinda sloppy melee first-person brawler. Its combat system isn't bad, but it gets clunky at times, specially in group fights. However, punching enemies into a 5 meter flight makes you feel like a badass. And the ragdoll physics on the corpses are a nice touch as well.  I haven't played Zeno Clash 2 yet, but I will soon enough, and I assume the combat system has been polished since 2009, although I've heard it focus too much on team fights, which is where the clumsiness comes in... But I digress.   The game shines in its world and characters, which are all really weird, but at the same time, charming. They present neat ideas that feel like they should have been much more explored and fleshed out, but everything seems experimental here, hence its length. For example: 'The Corwids are not slaves of reality, so they can be insane. Oxameter walks in a straight line without letting letting anything change his path... and that's what Oxameter does.' There are other Corwids with interesting... 'features', so I'd definitely recommend picking this up if you're interested in them alone.  Now, another problem I have, in regards to the exploration of the world, is that, since the game goes from one arena to the others, you barely have any time to explore the areas and take the time to appreciate the world they've created. While you're in combat, you'll be busy to look around, and the scenes end as soon and you beat everyone up. This still leaves you with an idea of what it is, but too vague for my liking. Again, I hope Zeno Clash II solves this 'issue'.  Voice acting is pretty bad, but it's bearable, and didn't ruin the overall experience for me. The cutscenes follow the same route, with some cheesy animations, but again, that wasn't my reason to be playing the game, so it didn't really make much of a difference.  So, for the conclusion. If you're interesting in world, creature and character design, this is definitely a must-buy. They've done a great job there, I thoroughly enjoyed it! If you're coming for the combat system, or a grand scale story... well, you'll not find it here, not quite. Still, I'd encourage you to pick it up on a sale, since it's a very interesting game to play. Well, I'm off to play Zeno Clash II now, I'm definitely interested in what comes next. Cheers!",1,0

The controller is alright if you either have a ps3 or Xbox controller.I don't recommend playing with a keyboard because it will make the gameplay very hard.The main problem is multiplayer, The Transmittion error. Namco Bandai and Cyber Connect 2 are aware of the ' Transmission Error ' when trying to fight other users online and the situation is currently being looked into and there was a patch but didn't fix it.Multiplayer is still fun and great but there is a likely hood that you will get a slideshow gameplay of ' Transmittion error' in the middle of the screen as you try to play.Even after the issue with multiplayer. I still recommand the game to anyone who is out there wanting to play this game if your interested in a anime,action and adventure game.That has a great Story line, Single player and multiplayer that is lacking with problems.The error ,for now, but it is very fun and great to play with people online.if you like these stuff i put down then this game is for you. i give Naruto Shippuden:Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst a 8.2 / 10",1,0

You will find that your old save files will take longer to load the more you play them, and the more DLCs you use for said save files. Hell, last time I played this game, my main save file took like two and a half hours to load. The Wish System in this game is supposed to encourage you to do different things with your Sims, but I find that it doesn't quite work as intended, ergo, the game can feel pretty monotonous at times.

275850,No Man's Sky,"Its amazing that this was announced at the end of 2013 and people are STILL asking 'What do you do?'  Do some homework man... you're on the internet already so go find out!  Anyways, heres my impressions after 10 hours. *NOTE* This game is running fine for me after a few modifications, more on that after my impressions.  After exploring 2 star systems, almost a dozen planets total, im happy to say those who like the exploring/survival/chill game will enjoy this for sure. After almost 70 hours in Subnautica, i knew i would enjoy NMS. There is so much to discover!! The file size is only 2.5GB, but only because of procedual generation taking so little space, its amazing how much there is to explore. All the amazing small details you wouldn't normally look for. For example, i left my game running for a bit on a planet during the night and the clear sky showed that the planet has its on rotation and i saw the night sky slowing pan from the left of the sky to the right.   The game does of a few cons i want to point out. - not much to do in space (perhaps that'll change the farther i get into the game) - space stations feel empty. those poor Geks just sit around all the time and do nothing! :( - Inventory is really hard to manage, find as many upgrade slots as possible - controls still feel likely clunky after the 1.0.3 patch, so hopefully that will be polished more in the future  I feel like im one of the lucky ones that can run the game with little to no problems. I can provide some help perhaps for people who have the Open GL window issue.  i7 4th gen gtx 760 16gb ram  I first started the game and OpenGL window came up so it has to do with the resolution. I dumbed down the res to the 'reconmeneded' settings (1360 x 768) and then the game was able to launch. I then switched the game to run on my other monitor at 1920 x 1080 and its been working fine for the most part. Changed the FOV settings to 140, setting fps to Max and ive been probably pushing over 60 fps so far. After a long play session, say 3-4 hours the game would slow down significantly where exiting and then going back in would resolve the issue. Perhaps my gpu ran out of memory? I don't know, but I know Hello Games is hard at work resolving these issues.  ",1,0

282070,This War of Mine,"Alright. Take a look at my hours. In this short amount of time, I can review this game with confidence.  I'd like to start off by saying that this is easily one of, if not THE best survival games I've ever played.   Now it's not a survival in the sense of minecraft, DAYZ, the forest, rust, etc.   In this case, survival means the most literal sense of the word, staying alive. When a character dies, they are dead, and stay that way. A nice perma-death feature keeps you on your game.  You are trying to survive (and live...or continue living) in a war ravaged city. You need to hunt for food, medicine, things to keep you warm, weapons, and other survivors, well the ones that don't want to kill you...or raid your house while you're out...  This game does not hold your hand, it's gritty, it puts you in an environment, and into situations where you actually need to think about what to do with your short time with the cover of darkness. It tugs at your morals, and makes you think things you don't want to.   Is it worth going to the supermarket, knowing there are armed bandits, to get food because we are out? OR do we need to trade away our supplies for medicine, to save a woman and her children?  Every decision matters, try not to make bad ones....your game may end faster than it started.  BUT, you can always start over, make different decisions, kill (or help) more people, blah blah...  So with all that, I highly recommend this game if you are into any sort of survival, fight for your life game.  11/10. The story, the gameplay, idea, visual theme, atmosphere, its all great! I'm sure there's more stuff but hey, I'm really enjoying it. I can see myself playing this for a long long time....",1,0

Once you dig beneath the surface though what remains is your typical walking simulator game, with all the requisite puzzles and hidden pieces of text to flesh out the world. Whilst it’s worth playing for the graphics alone I really can’t say that there was much more that drew me in, mostly due to my resistance to reading large walls of text after I’ve slowly trotted my way through everything. Still I’m sure fans of this genre will find a lot to love and would not hesitate to recommend it to all the indie fans out there.

Atmosphere is really well done, the AI don't talk nearly as much as they did in the beta, which is great. The enemies are just a little too cartoonish to be scary.   I'm not a fan of the skill tree they're building - sure, there are four areas to choose from, but your choices are made for you in each category. I would have liked a little more choice - maybe two or three options per milestone.   Sound production for music &amp; background noise is good, but the weapons still need to not sound as ... generic? I guess, as they do.   Level design feels intuitive and there's a lot of places to go that aren't specifically about the mission.   It would have been nice if the major relics you recover had some influence on gameplay, even if it was simply stat-driven. But I mean, I just picked up a kickass looking power sword, and you're telling me it's ... decoration? :(   Anyway, fun game so far, 7/10, would wonder why the blood isn't purple again.      ",1,0

CONS: - Health complications: eye disease (vitreous floaters), heart disease, hyperventilation, epilepsy, seizures, etc.. You name it.   Final Remarks: If you are a type of gamer who likes to torture yourself,  One Finger Death Punch  (OFDP) is the perfect game for you. Unlike other crazy twitch reflex games, OFDP is a lot easier and forgiving because it gives you more than one health and various perks that immensely help you progress. If you constantly fail and have hard time beating at certain points, like I said the game will slow down to match your current skill level (reaction time and reflexes) and the game speed will increase if you don't make any mistakes or die. I assure you that the game is eventually beatable even if you are not fast enough.   I am real pro at this game so I can't resist bragging my awesome ♥♥♥♥ here.

B: 'A Q6600 Quadcore OCed to 3.2 GHz' A: 'Buy a Core iX Haswell CPU or equivalent and come back if you have: out!'  This is one of the very few games that even 8 years after its release manages to strain the most expensive hardware available. That is because Supreme Commander (FA) is a massively grand game. And a superb one at that. (And one that is not well optimized for todays multithreading).  You want to fight 11 other players on giant maps in the air, on sea and on land? Check. You want to crush the shield-generators of your opponents base with 500 Bombers just because you feel like it? No deal. Check. You want to have up to 12.000 Units duking it out in multiplayer? Sure, why not. Check.  One of the best alltime user-scores on metacritic proves that this one is a timeless classic. And even being a classic i often look at replays of my games and marvel at the level of detail that the designers have put into the game e.g. the little radar-antennas on my destroyers tracking the opponents, or the little Flak-cannons on deck training their barrels physically correct onto incoming airplanes. The game even today can be pure eyecandy.  The true joy though is in multiplayer, i will not go into further detail here...just buy it, its dirtcheap for what it offers, and try it out yourself. And oh, do not forget to install the community-driven multiplayer-lobby.

283470,The Secret Of Hildegards,"The character art is gorgeous (on the rare occasions you actually see it) and the music isn't bad.  That said, 'I do not think that word means what you think it means' seems to fit far more often than it should, especially for a hidden object game; a few objects seem to have their names switched, and others are just... off. For example, if it says you need to find a watch, you're probably looking for a wall or table clock. Many backgrounds have very dark edges where you have to be perfectly lined up and rather close to your monitor to find that last item or two. The other items? Well, if you go around and click anything that looks out of place, you'll probably find most of them within a minute. Minigames seem to switch between ridiculously easy and time consuming enough that you might as well wait for the skip button, with a couple that could really use an explanation tossed in the mix.  The story seems more like an outline to work with than something that should have been released - absolutely no character development means the few snippets we see make very little sense as a whole, the 'ending' in particular. Speaking of the ending, it's... not really an ending; I'm assuming there is or will be another game that picks up where it left off.  If you want item hunt after item hunt and very little else, this might be worth looking into. Otherwise, it wasn't even worth it as part of a bundle.",-1,0

417860,Emily is Away,"So, this game is free. (Obviously.) And it's a visual novel. I was bored, so I gave it a try. (Spoilers ahead!)  Honestly, I feel like this game could have been written out a lot better. I do like the simple style of it. There are some games I believe that don't need to be overcomplicated or over the top. However, the story of this game. Depending on who you are can either make you love it or hate it.  Basically, Emily is a girl you're friends with in high school. No matter what you do or choices you make. Emily and you never hook up. Never. It just all ends. The message I believe the game is trying to get across is that no matter if you feel you are better for someone, or CAN be better for someone. Sometimes that other person just doesn't feel the same way. It's their life, and they're going to make their own choices no matter what you do.   The only downside to this game is pretty much how it's been written. I really do wish the storyline branched out a little bit. Like, maybe Emily ends up with someone else who is kinder to her. Perhaps along the lines of 'I know we didn't work out, but you taught me a lot about how important a good relationship is' or something like that. Just something BETTER for both characters, you know?  Overall, I feel the game is pretty sad. It's not really anything great. I do like how you have to 'type' on your keyboard in the game to type your message out. I did grow attached to Emily a bit, and that's saying a lot. I remember those awkward years of being in high school and growing up. Those are hard years, and you really don't know how to define yourself as a person.   I hope the creator of this game continues and uses this game as a learning experience. I see a lot of potential for a really good visual novel game using this format they've created. It's not the BEST by any means, but it certainly has a lot of untapped potential. Perhaps being able to talk with several different characters and see how their live's progress and being able to make more choices that have a greater effect overall in the game so there are multiple endings/outcomes.  Either way, if you want a throwback to your old days as a teen give the game a playthrough or two. It's free, and it really doesn't take that long. I rather liked it myself, but there could be so much more done with it. I hope the creator reads this review (and others) and takes in the constructive cricistim to make something that has the potential to be truly great.   ",1,0

Your a worm you can customize your worms color or add a personal touch with a picture there are sevral diffrent sections of the game to play in , Free for all seems to be the most popular . the idea of the game is to stay alive by not hitting any other worms or walls . now when u do die you turn into little balls that can be eaten by other worms making them bigger. so once a big worm dies you will see a crowd of worms headed in one direction quickly to get as big as they can , there are draw backs to being big, your slower , takes more room to make turns etc.... amoung the many bugs you will be eating there are gold coins to buy shields, weapons, etc etc some of these things give you a fighting chance to be in first place . but once in first place you become a huge target so keep moving, most important this is a game so dont take things personal its fun as long as you can laugh things off and go about your way....... oh yeah watch out for people that team up",1,0
7670,BioShock,"This game is just like every other bioshock game;highly overrated repetetive gameplay. The game has an okay story, but it's a bit hard to follow, and it's novelty wears off after a hour or so. The game does manage to somehow create a nice atmosphere, but the graphics are pretty bad. This game is just like Bioshock 1,2,inifinite, you shoot guns alot while running through atmospheric room, which is the same as every other room in the game(there is some variation). I can not reccomend buying this game, it is just too boring( I have tried playing this game a few times).  I would give this series a 6/10, if you're really really bored I guess it's a time killer, but it's a mindless game.",-1,0

278360,A Story About My Uncle,"First of all, I really don't think the game deserves the ''very positive'' rating it has on steam right now.  The game itself is very short, and therefore I never found myself really engaged in the main story. The fantastic world that's there to discover is bland as there is hardly anything for you to interact with.   The graphics are ok and the fantasy world looks decent, but the animations, on the other hand, feel outdated.  The gameplay is the game's strong part, but even its uniqueness eventually wears off and it starts to feel repetitive around halfway through. I also encountered a few glitches where I found myself stuck between rocks and stuff. Sometimes I managed to pull myself out, sometimes I didn't and had to restart.  Would not recommend it unless it is on sale.",-1,0

232430,Gone Home,"I'll start out by saying, this game is not for everyone. And from the reviews thus far, most people don't seem to be very happy with it; however, I do have some positive things to say about Gone Home. Personally, I enjoyed it.  I started Gone Home without expecting much, I knew it wasn't your average action-packed, puzzle solving game. Gone Home is more exploratory, it's an interactive story in which you explore your empty home to discover what happened. Why is nobody home? Where did everybody go? There is definitely quite a lot of rooms, drawers, cabinets, etc. to explore, which adds a bit it to the already short game time. I found myself wanting to know more about the family, and their story as the game progressed. The story in the game pulled at my emotions, I went from 'pssh...typical teenage behavior!' to feelings of hope and sadness...basically, if you're into storylines, this game is for you.  All in all, even though Gone Home is a simple point-and-click with absolutely zero action, I found that it is definitely worth playing.",1,0

340730,Sunrider Academy,"TL;DR at bottom. Also, I played the game using the optional uncensor-patch provided by the devs. Check the pinned discussions in the games forums, I recommend using it, the added content is tasteful and serves to further develop characters, as well as provide greater emotional connection to the characters.  Okay, so now that I have finished the game, I've decided to completely redo my review. First things first: Before you play this, at least play through most of the original game, Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius. It is free, it is wonderful, and this game contains a lot of references to that one. Seriously, it's phenomenal, free or not, and it's not even finished, another episode will be added later this year.   This games biggest weakness is pacing, both story-wise and gameplay-wise. The story pacing issues are made worse by the gameplay pacing issues, as sometimes reaching a certain even or fulfilling the requirements to trigger an event can either take a very long time, or if you didn't manage things well or hadn't yet figured out the game in the case of triggering an event, attempts to do so can make things more difficult for you.   The beginning of the game is very fast and doesn't explain itself well, and the end becomes a mindless cycle after the first go because nothing really matters at that point. For a game that requires multiple playthroughs to experience all the stories, the gameplay lacks variety, as the majority of the requirements are identical for each route. That said, once it's figured out, you can speed through the downtime fairly quickly, and if you find the stat managing gameplay unenjoyable or too difficult, there is a mode that makes it impossible to fail, so you can just experience the story, which is well worth the price alone, in my opinion.   As for the story, pacing is inconsistent. Each of the routes is paced differently, which is both good and bad. Good in that it keeps things varied, bad in that a couple of sections in a couple of the 4 routes available feel... slow. I found myself growing impatient, made worse by the fact that I was reaching the point in the game where the gameplay becomes a mindless routine where nothing is really significant. The slow sections have a purpose, and in the context of the story alone are understandable and meaningful, if not the most engaging, but they are made somewhat frustrating by the monotony of the gameplay during that portion of the route.   That pretty much covers the slightly more objective issues with the game. I personally don't really have many other criticisms, and no major ones to speak of. The music of the game is nice, but the tracks are rather short, and they loop during any given section, which can be annoying during particularly long story sequences. It didn't bother me much, but I did notice. Other little things include minor typos and slightly awkward phrasing, which were noticeable but didn't take away from the writing in any real sense.   So, on to the things that I like about the game. The writing is really strong. The stories that are told have great variety, strong plot twists, and generally have a lot of impact. The characters all have unique personalities and grow throughout the game, changing in various ways, doing unexpected things and genuinely surprising the player. This is true for all the routes, I found the stories told to be engaging, emotional, fun and heartwarming, and they all have their fair share of laughs. The support characters are all very interesting as well.   On to the art style. Its anime, okay? If you don't like anime, why are you here? That said, I don't feel that the art is generic or cliche. The character designs are all reasonably grounded, there are no crazy hair or overly stylized outfits, and each of the characters are easily distinguishable by more than just hair. The backgrounds are satisfactory. A couple of them are quite exceptional, the rest are just okay, but none of them are bad. The CG's are all nice as well, and while I do have my personal favorites, that is going to be a very personal preference, and all were of good quality.   TL:DR: This game has its issues. The first playthrough is tense and fun, well paced with common events, the following 3 to finish the remaining routes suffer from a lack of challenge and slower pacing due to already having experienced the common events. Outside of that, I absolutely adored this game, and didn't feel that these issues lessened my enjoyment too greatly. The characters are great, the writing does nearly everything right, there is a lot of variety story-wise, and the art is all high-quality and thoroughly enjoyable. I wholeheartedly recommend this one, but if you have yet to play the original game, Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius, play it first. It is great, it's free, and it makes this game a better experience.",1,0

Lots of people everywhere, insane amount of weapons, vehicles and so fourth. The game has a few DLC's some are worth it some are only if you really want them. As much as I do enjoy playing (still playing as of today) the player base has fallen a lot. Where I used to see 100's of players I now see a handful, but Trion are still supporting the game and its enjoyable.

255520,Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior,"This game came bundled with Shadow Warrior and I played it through and got 100 % achievements in two hours of playtime. So, what can you write about a game after 2 hours of perfect completition?  Probably you already know the point of this game: you need to clean up the place with a mop and water. You incinerate the objects you find on the floor and you collect money to get the two million dollar achievement and make sure you don't incinerate the money in the process.  So, the idea is nice, but I'll be honest: collecting and washing up for two hours is perfectly enough. It was fun for free, but I'd not really wished to pay for this (the same stands for the another Viscera spinoff: Santa's Rampage... maybe I'll get that once, but not sure).  The physics sometimes a little weird, but it's acceptable. The only thing which really bothered me was when I put objects into the biohazard bucket then tried to bring the bucket to the incinerator, the objects inside were jumping annoyingly. This usually made me just bring the objects one by one to the incinerator instead of putting them into the bucket.  So yeah: wouldn't really buy it for over a dollar but it's fine in a bundle. I had some fun for free and we owe a huge 'thank you' for the developers to provide this game for us. If you have one or two free hours and you want to have two extra achievements, play this, it's a nice little game. Otherwise just stick with Shadow Warrior and do the cleaning in real life between levels. :)",1,0
