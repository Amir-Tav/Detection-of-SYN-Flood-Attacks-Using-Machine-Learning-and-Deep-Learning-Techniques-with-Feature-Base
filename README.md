# Predicting Long Term Game Success from Early Steam Reviews Using-AI

we will be suing the following datasets:

DB 1(Steam Reviews): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/steam-reviews/data
DB 2(Steam Reviews Dataset 2021): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/najzeko/steam-reviews-2021

thus the combined data will give us DB 3, which will be used for our work.

## The question?

**Can we predict a game's long-term player retention and success based on early-stage Steam reviews, sentiment dynamics, and community engagement patterns?**
•	Complexity: Involves multiple factors like review sentiment, topic modelling, engagement patterns, and time-series trends.
•	Novelty: Most research focuses only on sentiment analysis, while this aims to predict long-term game success beyond immediate reviews.
•	Real-world Impact: Game developers and publishers can use this insight to improve game design, marketing strategies, and player retention.
